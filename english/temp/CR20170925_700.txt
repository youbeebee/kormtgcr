7. Additional Rules

700. General

700.1. Anything that happens in a game is an event. Multiple events may take place during the resolution of a spell or ability. The text of triggered abilities and replacement effects defines the event they�re looking for. One �happening� may be treated as a single event by one ability and as multiple events by another.
Example: If an attacking creature is blocked by two creatures, this is one event for a triggered ability that reads �Whenever [this creature] becomes blocked� but two events for a triggered ability that reads �Whenever [this creature] becomes blocked by a creature.�

700.2. A spell or ability is modal if it has two or more options in a bulleted list preceded by instructions for a player to choose a number of those options, such as �Choose one �.� Each of those options is a mode. Modal cards printed prior to the Khans of Tarkir set didn�t use bulleted lists for the modes; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference so the modes do appear in a bulleted list.

700.2a The controller of a modal spell or activated ability chooses the mode(s) as part of casting that spell or activating that ability. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can�t be chosen. (See rule 601.2b.)

700.2b The controller of a modal triggered ability chooses the mode(s) as part of putting that ability on the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can�t be chosen. If no mode can be chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule 603.3c.)

700.2c If a spell or ability targets one or more targets only if a particular mode is chosen for it, its controller will need to choose those targets only if they chose that mode. Otherwise, the spell or ability is treated as though it did not have those targets. (See rule 601.2c.)

700.2d If a player is allowed to choose more than one mode for a modal spell or ability, that player normally can�t choose the same mode more than once. However, a few modal spells include the instruction �You may choose the same mode more than once.� If a particular mode is chosen multiple times, the spell is treated as if that mode appeared that many times in sequence. If that mode requires a target, the same player or object may be chosen as the target for each of those modes, or different targets may be chosen.

700.2e Some spells and abilities specify that a player other than their controller chooses a mode for it. In that case, the other player does so when the spell or ability�s controller normally would do so. If there is more than one other player who could make such a choice, the spell or ability�s controller decides which of those players will make the choice.

700.2f Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. Changing a spell or ability�s target can�t change its mode.

700.2g A copy of a modal spell or ability copies the mode(s) chosen for it. The controller of the copy can�t choose a different mode. (See rule 706.10.)

700.3. Some effects cause objects to be temporarily grouped into piles.

700.3a Each of the affected objects must be put into exactly one of those piles, unless the effect specifies otherwise.

700.3b Each object in a pile is still an individual object. The pile is not an object.

700.3c Objects grouped into piles don�t leave the zone they�re currently in. If cards in a graveyard are split into piles, the order of the graveyard must be maintained.
Example: Fact or Fiction reads, �Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.� While an opponent is separating the revealed cards into piles, they�re still in their owner�s library. They don�t leave the library until they�re put into their owner�s hand or graveyard.

700.3d A pile can contain zero or more objects.

700.4. The term dies means �is put into a graveyard from the battlefield.�

700.5. A player�s devotion to [color] is equal to the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents that player controls. A player�s devotion to [color 1] and [color 2] is equal to the number of mana symbols among the mana costs of permanents that player controls that are [color 1], [color 2], or both colors.

700.6. The term historic refers to an object that has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype.

700.7. Some cards refer to cards with a name originally printed in a particular set.

700.7a One card (City in a Bottle) refers to permanents and cards with a name originally printed in the Arabian Nights� expansion. Those names are Abu Ja�far, Aladdin, Aladdin�s Lamp, Aladdin�s Ring, Ali Baba, Ali from Cairo, Army of Allah, Bazaar of Baghdad, Bird Maiden, Bottle of Suleiman, Brass Man, Camel, City in a Bottle, City of Brass, Cuombajj Witches, Cyclone, Dancing Scimitar, Dand�n, Desert, Desert Nomads, Desert Twister, Diamond Valley, Drop of Honey, Ebony Horse, Elephant Graveyard, El-Hajj�j, Erg Raiders, Erhnam Djinn, Eye for an Eye, Fishliver Oil, Flying Carpet, Flying Men, Ghazb�n Ogre, Giant Tortoise, Guardian Beast, Hasran Ogress, Hurr Jackal, Ifh-Biff Efreet, Island Fish Jasconius, Island of Wak-Wak, Jandor�s Ring, Jandor�s Saddlebags, Jeweled Bird, Jihad, Jun�n Efreet, Juz�m Djinn, Khab�l Ghoul, King Suleiman, Kird Ape, Library of Alexandria, Magnetic Mountain, Merchant Ship, Metamorphosis, Mijae Djinn, Moorish Cavalry, Nafs Asp, Oasis, Old Man of the Sea, Oubliette, Piety, Pyramids, Repentant Blacksmith, Ring of Ma�r�f, Rukh Egg, Sandals of Abdallah, Sandstorm, Serendib Djinn, Serendib Efreet, Shahrazad, Sindbad, Singing Tree, Sorceress Queen, Stone-Throwing Devils, Unstable Mutation, War Elephant, Wyluli Wolf, and Ydwen Efreet.

Those names are Abbey Gargoyles; Abbey Matron; Aether Storm; Aliban�s Tower; Ambush; Ambush Party; Anaba Ancestor; Anaba Bodyguard; Anaba Shaman; Anaba Spirit Crafter; An-Havva Constable; An-Havva Inn; An-Havva Township; An-Zerrin Ruins; Apocalypse Chime; Autumn Willow; Aysen Abbey; Aysen Bureaucrats; Aysen Crusader; Aysen Highway; Baki�s Curse; Baron Sengir; Beast Walkers; Black Carriage; Broken Visage; Carapace; Castle Sengir; Cemetery Gate; Chain Stasis; Chandler; Clockwork Gnomes; Clockwork Steed; Clockwork Swarm; Coral Reef; Dark Maze; Daughter of Autumn; Death Speakers; Didgeridoo; Drudge Spell; Dry Spell; Dwarven Pony; Dwarven Sea Clan; Dwarven Trader; Ebony Rhino; Eron the Relentless; Evaporate; Faerie Noble; Feast of the Unicorn; Feroz�s Ban; Folk of An-Havva; Forget; Funeral March; Ghost Hounds; Giant Albatross; Giant Oyster; Grandmother Sengir; Greater Werewolf; Hazduhr the Abbot; Headstone; Heart Wolf; Hungry Mist; Ihsan�s Shade; Irini Sengir; Ironclaw Curse; Jinx; Joven; Joven�s Ferrets; Joven�s Tools; Koskun Falls; Koskun Keep; Labyrinth Minotaur; Leaping Lizard; Leeches; Mammoth Harness; Marjhan; Memory Lapse; Merchant Scroll; Mesa Falcon; Mystic Decree; Narwhal; Orcish Mine; Primal Order; Prophecy; Rashka the Slayer; Reef Pirates; Renewal; Retribution; Reveka, Wizard Savant; Root Spider; Roots; Roterothopter; Rysorian Badger; Samite Alchemist; Sea Sprite; Sea Troll; Sengir Autocrat; Sengir Bats; Serra Aviary; Serra Bestiary; Serra Inquisitors; Serra Paladin; Serrated Arrows; Shrink; Soraya the Falconer; Spectral Bears; Timmerian Fiends; Torture; Trade Caravan; Truce; Veldrane of Sengir; Wall of Kelp; Willow Faerie; Willow Priestess; Winter Sky; and Wizards� School.

701. Keyword Actions

701.1. Most actions described in a card�s rules text use the standard English definitions of the verbs within, but some specialized verbs are used whose meanings may not be clear. These �keywords� are game terms; sometimes reminder text summarizes their meanings.

701.2. Activate

701.2a To activate an activated ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object�s controller (or its owner, if it doesn�t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. A player may activate an ability if they have priority. See rule 602, �Activating Activated Abilities.�

701.3. Attach

701.3a To attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object means to take it from where it currently is and put it onto that object. If something is attached to a permanent on the battlefield, it�s customary to place it so that it�s physically touching the permanent. An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification can�t be attached to an object it couldn�t enchant, equip, or fortify, respectively.

701.3b If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object it can�t be attached to, the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification doesn�t move. If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to the object it�s already attached to, the effect does nothing. If an effect tries to attach an object that isn�t an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to another object or player, the effect does nothing and the first object doesn�t move.

701.3c Attaching an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification on the battlefield to a different object causes the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to receive a new timestamp.

701.3d To �unattach� an Equipment from a creature means to move it away from that creature so the Equipment is on the battlefield but is not equipping anything. It should no longer be physically touching any creature. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that was attached to an object or player ceases to be attached to it, that counts as �becoming unattached [from that object or player]�; this includes if that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification leaves the battlefield, the object leaves the zone it was in, or that player leaves the game.

701.4. Cast

701.4a To cast a spell is to take it from the zone it�s in (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. A player may cast a spell if they have priority. See rule 601, �Casting Spells.�

701.4b To cast a card is to cast it as a spell.

701.5. Counter

701.5a To counter a spell or ability means to cancel it, removing it from the stack. It doesn�t resolve and none of its effects occur. A countered spell is put into its owner�s graveyard.

701.5b The player who cast a countered spell or activated a countered ability doesn�t get a �refund� of any costs that were paid.

701.6. Create

701.6a To create one or more tokens with certain characteristics, put the specified number of tokens with the specified characteristics onto the battlefield.

701.6b Previously, an effect that created tokens instructed a player to �put [those tokens] onto the battlefield.� Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now �create� those tokens.

701.7. Destroy

701.7a To destroy a permanent, move it from the battlefield to its owner�s graveyard.

701.7b The only ways a permanent can be destroyed are as a result of an effect that uses the word �destroy� or as a result of the state-based actions that check for lethal damage (see rule 704.5g) or damage from a source with deathtouch (see rule 704.5h). If a permanent is put into its owner�s graveyard for any other reason, it hasn�t been �destroyed.�

701.7c A regeneration effect replaces a destruction event. See rule 701.14, �Regenerate.�

701.8. Discard

701.8a To discard a card, move it from its owner�s hand to that player�s graveyard.

701.8b By default, effects that cause a player to discard a card allow the affected player to choose which card to discard. Some effects, however, require a random discard or allow another player to choose which card is discarded.

701.8c If a card is discarded, but an effect causes it to be put into a hidden zone instead of into its owner�s graveyard without being revealed, all values of that card�s characteristics are considered to be undefined. If a card is discarded this way to pay a cost that specifies a characteristic about the discarded card, that cost payment is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the cost was paid (see rule 721, �Handling Illegal Actions�).

701.9. Double

701.9a Doubling a creature�s power and/or toughness creates a continuous effect. This effect modifies that creature�s power and/or toughness but doesn�t set those characteristics to a specific value. See rule 613.3c.

701.9b To double a creature�s power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is that creature�s power as the spell or ability that doubles its power resolves. Similarly, an effect that doubles a creature�s toughness gives it +0/+X, where X is that creature�s toughness. Doubling a creature�s power and toughness gives it +X/+Y, where X is its power and Y is its toughness.

701.9c If a creature�s power is less than 0 when it�s doubled, doubling that creature�s power instead means that the creature gets -X/-0, where X is the difference between 0 and its power. Similarly, if its toughness is less than 0 when doubled, it gets -0/-X. If one characteristic�s value is negative but the other isn�t when both are doubled, it gets -X/+Y or +X/-Y, as appropriate.

701.9d To double a player�s life total, the player gains or loses an amount of life such that their new life total is twice its current value.

701.9e To double the number of a kind of counters on a player or permanent, give that player or permanent as many of those counters as that player or permanent already has.

701.9f To double the amount of a type of mana in a player�s mana pool, that player adds an amount of mana of that type equal to the amount they already have.

701.10. Exchange

701.10a A spell or ability may instruct players to exchange something (for example, life totals or control of two permanents) as part of its resolution. When such a spell or ability resolves, if the entire exchange can�t be completed, no part of the exchange occurs.
Example: If a spell attempts to exchange control of two target creatures but one of those creatures is destroyed before the spell resolves, the spell does nothing to the other creature.

701.10b When control of two permanents is exchanged, if those permanents are controlled by different players, each of those players simultaneously gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player. If, on the other hand, those permanents are controlled by the same player, the exchange effect does nothing.

701.10c When life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player�s previous life total. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them. A player who can�t gain life can�t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can�t lose life can�t be given a lower life total this way (see rules 118.7�8).

701.10d Some spells or abilities may instruct a player to exchange cards in one zone with cards in a different zone (for example, exiled cards and cards in a player�s hand). These spells and abilities work the same as other �exchange� spells and abilities, except they can exchange the cards only if all the cards are owned by the same player, and they can exchange the cards even if one zone is empty.

701.10e If a card in one zone is exchanged with a card in a different zone, and either of them is attached to an object, that card stops being attached to that object and the other card becomes attached to that object.

701.10f If a spell or ability instructs a player to simply exchange two zones, and one of the zones is empty, the cards in the zones are still exchanged.

701.10g A spell or ability may instruct a player to exchange two numerical values. In such an exchange, each value becomes equal to the previous value of the other. If either of those values is a life total, the affected player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other value. Replacement effects may modify this gain or loss, and triggered abilities may trigger on it. A player who can�t gain life can�t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can�t lose life can�t be given a lower life total this way (see rules 118.7�8). If either of those values is a power or toughness, a continuous effect is created setting that power or toughness to the other value (see rule 613.3b). This rule does not apply to spells and abilities that switch a creature�s power and toughness.

701.11. Exile

701.11a To exile an object, move it to the exile zone from wherever it is. See rule 406, �Exile.�

701.12. Fight

701.12a A spell or ability may instruct a creature to fight another creature or it may instruct two creatures to fight each other. Each of those creatures deals damage equal to its power to the other creature.

701.12b If a creature instructed to fight is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a creature, no damage is dealt. If a creature is an illegal target for a resolving spell or ability that instructs it to fight, no damage is dealt.

701.12c If a creature fights itself, it deals damage to itself equal to twice its power.

701.12d The damage dealt when a creature fights isn�t combat damage.

701.13. Play

701.13a To play a land means to put it onto the battlefield from the zone it�s in (usually the hand). A player may play a land if they have priority, it�s the main phase of their turn, the stack is empty, and they haven�t played a land this turn. Playing a land is a special action (see rule 115), so it doesn�t use the stack; it simply happens. Putting a land onto the battlefield as the result of a spell or ability isn�t the same as playing a land. See rule 305, �Lands.�

701.13b To play a card means to play that card as a land or to cast that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.

701.13c Some effects instruct a player to �play� with a certain aspect of the game changed, such as �Play with the top card of your library revealed.� �Play� in this sense means to play the Magic game.

701.13d Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as �playing� that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to �casting� that spell or that card.

701.13e Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as �playing� that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to �activating� that ability.

701.14. Regenerate

701.14a If the effect of a resolving spell or ability regenerates a permanent, it creates a replacement effect that protects the permanent the next time it would be destroyed this turn. In this case, �Regenerate [permanent]� means �The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it�s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.�

701.14b If the effect of a static ability regenerates a permanent, it replaces destruction with an alternate effect each time that permanent would be destroyed. In this case, �Regenerate [permanent]� means �Instead remove all damage marked on [permanent] and tap it. If it�s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.�

701.14c Neither activating an ability that creates a regeneration shield nor casting a spell that creates a regeneration shield is the same as regenerating a permanent. Effects that say that a permanent can�t be regenerated don�t preclude such abilities from being activated or such spells from being cast; rather, they cause regeneration shields to not be applied.

701.15. Reveal

701.15a To reveal a card, show that card to all players for a brief time. If an effect causes a card to be revealed, it remains revealed for as long as necessary to complete the parts of the effect that card is relevant to. If the cost to cast a spell or activate an ability includes revealing a card, the card remains revealed from the time the spell or ability is announced until the time it leaves the stack.

701.15b Revealing a card doesn�t cause it to leave the zone it�s in.

701.15c If cards in a player�s library are shuffled or otherwise reordered, any revealed cards that are reordered stop being revealed and become new objects.

701.15d Some effects instruct a player to look at one or more cards. Looking at a card follows the same rules as revealing a card, except that the card is shown only to the specified player.

701.16. Sacrifice

701.16a To sacrifice a permanent, its controller moves it from the battlefield directly to its owner�s graveyard. A player can�t sacrifice something that isn�t a permanent, or something that�s a permanent they don�t control. Sacrificing a permanent doesn�t destroy it, so regeneration or other effects that replace destruction can�t affect this action.

701.17. Scry

701.17a To �scry N� means to look at the top N cards of your library, put any number of them on the bottom of your library in any order and the rest on top of your library in any order.

701.17b If a player is instructed to scry 0, no scry event occurs. Abilities that trigger whenever a player scries won�t trigger.

701.17c If multiple players scry at once, each of those players looks at the top cards of their library at the same time. Those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) where to put those cards, then those cards move at the same time.

701.18. Search

701.18a To search for a card in a zone, look at all cards in that zone (even if it�s a hidden zone) and find a card that matches the given description.

701.18b If a player is searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated quality, such as a card with a certain card type or color, that player isn�t required to find some or all of those cards even if they�re present in that zone.
Example: Splinter says �Exile target artifact. Search its controller�s graveyard, hand, and library for all cards with the same name as that artifact and exile them. Then that player shuffles their library.� A player casts Splinter targeting Howling Mine (an artifact). Howling Mine�s controller has another Howling Mine in her graveyard and two more in her library. Splinter�s controller must find the Howling Mine in the graveyard, but may choose to find zero, one, or two of the Howling Mines in the library.

701.18c If a player is instructed to search a hidden zone for cards that match an undefined quality, that player may still search that zone but can�t find any cards.
Example: Lobotomy says �Target player reveals their hand, then you choose a card other than a basic land card from it. Search that player�s graveyard, hand, and library for all cards with the same name as the chosen card and exile them. Then that player shuffles their library.� If the target player has no cards in their hand when Lobotomy resolves, the player who cast Lobotomy searches the specified zones but doesn�t exile any cards.

701.18d If a player is searching a hidden zone simply for a quantity of cards, such as �a card� or �three cards,� that player must find that many cards (or as many as possible, if the zone doesn�t contain enough cards).

701.18e If the effect that contains the search instruction doesn�t also contain instructions to reveal the found card(s), then they�re not revealed.

701.18f If searching a zone is replaced with searching a portion of that zone, any other instructions that refer to searching the zone still apply. Any abilities that trigger on a library being searched will trigger.
Example: Aven Mindcensor says, in part, �If an opponent would search a library, that player searches the top four cards of that library instead.� Veteran Explorer says �When Veteran Explorer dies, each player may search their library for up to two basic land cards and put them onto the battlefield. Then each player who searched their library this way shuffles it.� An opponent who searched the top four cards of their library because of Veteran Explorer�s ability would shuffle the entire library.

701.18g If an effect offers a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards found, that player may choose to search even if the additional actions are illegal or impossible.

701.18h If multiple players search at once, each of those players looks at the appropriate cards at the same time, then those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) which card to find.

701.19. Shuffle

701.19a To shuffle a library or a face-down pile of cards, randomize the cards within it so that no player knows their order.

701.19b Some effects cause a player to search a library for a card or cards, shuffle that library, then put the found card or cards in a certain position in that library. Even though the found card or cards never leave that library, they aren�t included in the shuffle. Rather, all the cards in that library except those are shuffled. Abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger. See also rule 401, �Library.�

701.19c If an effect would cause a player to shuffle one or more specific objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if none of those objects are in the zone they�re expected to be in or an effect causes all of those objects to be moved to another zone or remain in their current zone.
Example: Guile says, in part, �When Guile is put into a graveyard from anywhere, shuffle it into its owner�s library.� It�s put into a graveyard and its ability triggers, then a player exiles it from that graveyard in response. When the ability resolves, the library is shuffled.
Example: Black Sun�s Zenith says, in part, �Shuffle Black Sun�s Zenith into its owner�s library.� Black Sun�s Zenith is in a graveyard, has gained flashback (due to Recoup, perhaps), and is cast from that graveyard. Black Sun�s Zenith will be exiled, and its owner�s library will be shuffled.

701.19d If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a set of objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if there are no objects in that set.
Example: Loaming Shaman says �When Loaming Shaman enters the battlefield, target player shuffles any number of target cards from their graveyard into their library.� It enters the battlefield, its ability triggers, and no cards are targeted. When the ability resolves, the targeted player will still have to shuffle their library.

701.19e If an effect causes a player to shuffle a library containing zero or one cards, abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger.

701.19f If two or more effects cause a library to be shuffled multiple times simultaneously, abilities that trigger when that library is shuffled will trigger that many times.

701.20. Tap and Untap

701.20a To tap a permanent, turn it sideways from an upright position. Only untapped permanents can be tapped.

701.20b To untap a permanent, rotate it back to the upright position from a sideways position. Only tapped permanents can be untapped.

701.21. Fateseal

701.21a To �fateseal N� means to look at the top N cards of an opponent�s library, put any number of them on the bottom of that library in any order and the rest on top of that library in any order.

701.22. Clash

701.22a To clash, a player reveals the top card of their library. That player may then put that card on the bottom of their library.

701.22b �Clash with an opponent� means �Choose an opponent. You and that opponent each clash.�

701.22c Each clashing player reveals the top card of their library at the same time. Then those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) where to put those cards, then those cards move at the same time.

701.22d A player wins a clash if that player revealed a card with a higher converted mana cost than all other cards revealed in that clash.

701.23. Planeswalk

701.23a A player may planeswalk only during a Planechase game. Only the planar controller may planeswalk. See rule 901, �Planechase.�

701.23b To planeswalk is to put each face-up plane card and phenomenon card on the bottom of its owner�s planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up.

701.23c A player may planeswalk as the result of the �planeswalking ability� (see rule 901.8), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenon�s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.5x). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.

701.23d The plane card that�s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card that�s turned face down or that leaves the game is the plane the player planeswalks away from. The same is true with respect to phenomena.

701.24. Set in Motion

701.24a Only a scheme card may be set in motion, and only during an Archenemy game. Only the archenemy may set a scheme card in motion. See rule 312, �Schemes,� and rule 904, �Archenemy.�

701.24b To set a scheme in motion, move it off the top of your scheme deck if it�s on top of your scheme deck and turn it face up if it isn�t face up. That scheme is considered to have been set in motion even if neither of these actions was performed on it.

701.24c Schemes may only be set in motion one at a time. If a player is instructed to set multiple schemes in motion, that player sets a scheme in motion that many times.

701.25. Abandon

701.25a Only a face-up ongoing scheme card may be abandoned, and only during an Archenemy game. See rule 312, �Schemes,� and rule 904, �Archenemy.�

701.25b To abandon a scheme, turn it face down and put it on the bottom of its owner�s scheme deck.

701.26. Proliferate

701.26a To proliferate means to choose any number of permanents and/or players that have a counter, then give each exactly one additional counter of a kind that permanent or player already has.

701.26b If a permanent or player chosen this way has more than one kind of counter, the player who is proliferating chooses which kind of counter to add.

701.26c In a Two-Headed Giant game, poison counters are shared by the team. If more than one player on a team is chosen this way, only one of those players can be given an additional poison counter. See rule 810, �Two-Headed Giant Variant.�

701.27. Transform

701.27a To transform a permanent, turn it over so that its other face is up. Only permanents represented by double-faced cards can transform. (See rule 711, �Double-Faced Cards.�)

701.27b Although transforming a permanent uses the same physical action as turning a permanent face up or face down, they are different game actions. Abilities that trigger when a permanent is turned face down won�t trigger when that permanent transforms, and so on.

701.27c If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent that isn�t represented by a double-faced card, nothing happens.

701.27d If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent, and the face that permanent would transform into is represented by an instant or sorcery card face, nothing happens.

701.27e Some triggered abilities trigger when an object �transforms into� an object with a specified characteristic. Such an ability triggers if the object transforms and has the specified characteristic immediately after it transforms.

701.27f If an activated or triggered ability of a permanent that isn�t a delayed triggered ability of that permanent tries to transform it, the permanent transforms only if it hasn�t transformed since the ability was put onto the stack. If a delayed triggered ability of a permanent tries to transform that permanent, the permanent transforms only if it hasn�t transformed since that delayed triggered ability was created. In either case, if the permanent has already transformed, the instruction to transform is ignored.

701.28. Detain

701.28a Certain spells and abilities can detain a permanent. Until the next turn of the controller of that spell or ability, that permanent can�t attack or block and its activated abilities can�t be activated.

701.29. Populate

701.29a To populate means to choose a creature token you control and create a token that�s a copy of that creature token.

701.29b If you control no creature tokens when instructed to populate, you won�t create a token.

701.30. Monstrosity

701.30a �Monstrosity N� means �If this permanent isn�t monstrous, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes monstrous.�

701.30b Monstrous is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the monstrosity action and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become monstrous. Once a permanent becomes monstrous, it stays monstrous until it leaves the battlefield. Monstrous is neither an ability nor part of the permanent�s copiable values.

701.30c If a permanent�s ability instructs a player to �monstrosity X,� other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X as that permanent became monstrous.

701.31. Vote

701.31a Some spells and abilities instruct players to vote for one choice from a list of options to determine some aspect of the effect of that spell or ability. To vote, each player, starting with a specified player and proceeding in turn order, chooses one of those choices.

701.31b The listed choices may be objects, words with no rules meaning that are each connected to a different effect, or other variables relevant to the resolution of the spell or ability.

701.31c If the text of a spell or ability refers to �voting,� it refers only to an actual vote, not to any spell or ability that involves the players making choices or decisions without using the word �vote.�

701.31d If an effect gives a player multiple votes, those votes all happen at the same time the player would otherwise have voted.

701.32. Bolster

701.32a �Bolster N� means �Choose a creature you control with the least toughness or tied for least toughness among creatures you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.�

701.33. Manifest

701.33a To manifest a card, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Put that card onto the battlefield face down. That permanent is a manifested permanent as long as it remains face down. The effect defining its characteristics works while the card is face down and ends when it�s turned face up.

701.33b Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested permanent you control face up. This is a special action that doesn�t use the stack (see rule 115.2b). To do this, show all players that the card representing that permanent is a creature card and what that card�s mana cost is, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. (If the card representing that permanent isn�t a creature card or it doesn�t have a mana cost, it can�t be turned face up this way.)

701.33c If a card with morph is manifested, its controller may turn that card face up using either the procedure described in rule 702.36e to turn a face-down permanent with morph face up or the procedure described above to turn a manifested permanent face up.

701.33d If an effect instructs a player to manifest multiple cards from their library, those cards are manifested one at a time.

701.33e If an effect instructs a player to manifest a card and a rule or effect prohibits the face-down object from entering the battlefield, that card isn�t manifested. Its characteristics remain unmodified and it remains in its previous zone. If it was face up, it remains face up.

701.33f If a manifested permanent that�s represented by an instant or sorcery card would turn face up, its controller reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger whenever a permanent is turned face up won�t trigger.

701.33g See rule 707, �Face-Down Spells and Permanents,� for more information.

701.34. Support

701.34a �Support N� on a permanent means �Put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N other target creatures.� �Support N� on an instant or sorcery spell means �Put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N target creatures.�

701.35. Investigate

701.35a �Investigate� means �Create a colorless Clue artifact token with �{2}, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.��

701.36. Meld

701.36a Meld is a keyword action that appears in an ability on one card in a meld pair. (See rule 712, �Meld Cards.�) To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and combined. The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.

701.36b Only two cards belonging to the same meld pair can be melded. Tokens, cards that aren�t meld cards, or meld cards that don�t form a meld pair can�t be melded.

701.36c If an effect instructs a player to meld cards that can�t be melded, they stay in their current zone.
Example: A player owns and controls Midnight Scavengers and a token that�s a copy of Graf Rats. At the beginning of combat, both are exiled but can�t be melded. Midnight Scavengers remains exiled and the exiled token ceases to exist.

701.37. Goad

701.37a Certain spells and abilities can goad a creature. Until the next turn of the controller of that spell or ability, that creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than that player if able.

701.38. Exert

701.38a To exert a permanent, you choose to have it not untap during your next untap step.

701.38b A permanent can be exerted even if it�s not tapped or has already been exerted in a turn. If you exert a permanent more than once before your next untap step, each effect causing it not to untap expires during the same untap step.

701.38c An object that isn�t on the battlefield can�t be exerted.

701.38d �You may exert [this creature] as it attacks� is an optional cost to attack (see rule 508.1g). Some objects with this static ability have a triggered ability that triggers �when you do� printed in the same paragraph. These abilities are linked. (See rule 607.2g.)

701.39. Explore

701.39a Certain abilities instruct a permanent to explore. To do so, that permanent�s controller reveals the top card of their library. If a land card is revealed this way, that player puts that card into their hand. Otherwise, that player puts a +1/+1 counter on the exploring permanent and may put the revealed card into their graveyard.

701.39b A permanent �explores� after the process described in rule 701.39a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.

701.39c If a permanent changes zones before an effect causes it to explore, its last known information is used to determine which object explored and who controlled it.

701.40. Assemble

701.40a Assemble is a keyword action in the Unstable set that puts Contraptions onto the battlefield. Outside of silver-bordered cards, only one card (Steamflogger Boss) refers to assembling a Contraption. Cards and mechanics from the Unstable set aren�t included in these rules. See the Unstable FAQ for more information.

702. Keyword Abilities

702.1. Most abilities describe exactly what they do in the card�s rules text. Some, though, are very common or would require too much space to define on the card. In these cases, the object lists only the name of the ability as a �keyword�; sometimes reminder text summarizes the game rule.

702.1a If an effect refers to a �[keyword ability] cost,� it refers only to the variable costs for that keyword.
Example: Varolz, the Scar-Striped has an ability that says �Each creature card in your graveyard has scavenge. The scavenge cost is equal to its mana cost.� A creature card�s scavenge cost is an amount of mana equal to its mana cost, and the activation cost of the scavenge ability is that amount of mana plus �Exile this card from your graveyard.�

702.1b An effect that grants an object a keyword ability may define a variable in that ability based on characteristics of that object or other information about the game state. For these abilities, the value of that variable is constantly reevaluated.
Example: Volcano Hellion has the ability �Volcano Hellion has echo {X}, where X is your life total.� If your life total is 10 when Volcano Hellion�s echo ability triggers but 5 when it resolves, the echo cost to pay is {5}.
Example: Fire//Ice is a split card whose halves have the mana costs {1}{R} and {1}{U}. Past in Flames reads �Each instant and sorcery card in your graveyard gains flashback until end of turn. The flashback cost is equal to its mana cost.� Fire//Ice has �Flashback {2}{U}{R}� while it is in your graveyard, but if you choose to cast Fire, the resulting spell has �Flashback {1}{R}.�

702.2. Deathtouch

702.2a Deathtouch is a static ability.

702.2b A creature with toughness greater than 0 that�s been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked is destroyed as a state-based action. See rule 704.

702.2c Any nonzero amount of combat damage assigned to a creature by a source with deathtouch is considered to be lethal damage for the purposes of determining if a proposed combat damage assignment is valid, regardless of that creature�s toughness. See rules 510.1c�d.

702.2d The deathtouch rules function no matter what zone an object with deathtouch deals damage from.

702.2e If an object changes zones before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known information is used to determine whether it had deathtouch.

702.2f Multiple instances of deathtouch on the same object are redundant.

702.3. Defender

702.3a Defender is a static ability.

702.3b A creature with defender can�t attack.

702.3c Multiple instances of defender on the same creature are redundant.

702.4. Double Strike

702.4a Double strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. (See rule 510, �Combat Damage Step.�)

702.4b If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.

702.4c Removing double strike from a creature during the first combat damage step will stop it from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step.

702.4d Giving double strike to a creature with first strike after it has already dealt combat damage in the first combat damage step will allow the creature to assign combat damage in the second combat damage step.

702.4e Multiple instances of double strike on the same creature are redundant.

702.5. Enchant

702.5a Enchant is a static ability, written �Enchant [object or player].� The enchant ability restricts what an Aura spell can target and what an Aura can enchant.

702.5b For more information about Auras, see rule 303, �Enchantments.�

702.5c If an Aura has multiple instances of enchant, all of them apply. The Aura�s target must follow the restrictions from all the instances of enchant. The Aura can enchant only objects or players that match all of its enchant abilities.

702.5d Auras that can enchant a player can target and be attached to players. Such Auras can�t target permanents and can�t be attached to permanents.

702.6. Equip

702.6a Equip is an activated ability of Equipment cards. �Equip [cost]� means �[Cost]: Attach this permanent to target creature you control. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.�

702.6b For more information about Equipment, see rule 301, �Artifacts.�

702.6c �Equip [quality] creature� is a variant of the equip ability. �Equip [quality] [cost]� means �[Cost]: Attach this permanent to target [quality] creature you control. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.� This ability doesn�t restrict what the Equipment may be attached to.

702.6d An �equip [quality] creature� ability is an equip ability, and an �equip [quality] creature� cost is an equip cost. Any effect that modifies how or whether a player may activate an equip ability of an object affects �equip [quality] creature� abilities of that object. Any effect that increases or reduces an equip cost will increase or reduce a �equip [quality] creature� cost.

702.6e If a permanent has multiple equip abilities, any of its equip abilities may be activated.

702.7. First Strike

702.7a First strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. (See rule 510, �Combat Damage Step.�)

702.7b If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike or double strike (see rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.

702.7c Giving first strike to a creature without it after combat damage has already been dealt in the first combat damage step won�t preclude that creature from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step. Removing first strike from a creature after it has already dealt combat damage in the first combat damage step won�t allow it to also assign combat damage in the second combat damage step (unless the creature has double strike).

702.7d Multiple instances of first strike on the same creature are redundant.

702.8. Flash

702.8a Flash is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it�s on. �Flash� means �You may play this card any time you could cast an instant.�

702.8b Multiple instances of flash on the same object are redundant.

702.9. Flying

702.9a Flying is an evasion ability.

702.9b A creature with flying can�t be blocked except by creatures with flying and/or reach. A creature with flying can block a creature with or without flying. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step,� and rule 702.17, �Reach.�)

702.9c Multiple instances of flying on the same creature are redundant.

702.10. Haste

702.10a Haste is a static ability.

702.10b If a creature has haste, it can attack even if it hasn�t been controlled by its controller continuously since their most recent turn began. (See rule 302.6.)

702.10c If a creature has haste, its controller can activate its activated abilities whose cost includes the tap symbol or the untap symbol even if that creature hasn�t been controlled by that player continuously since their most recent turn began. (See rule 302.6.)

702.10d Multiple instances of haste on the same creature are redundant.

702.11. Hexproof

702.11a Hexproof is a static ability.

702.11b �Hexproof� on a permanent means �This permanent can�t be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.�

702.11c �Hexproof� on a player means �You can�t be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.�

702.11d �Hexproof from [quality]� is a variant of the hexproof ability. �Hexproof from [quality]� on a permanent means �This permanent can�t be the target of [quality] spells your opponents control or abilities your opponents control from [quality] sources.� A �hexproof from [quality]� ability is a hexproof ability.

702.11e Any effect that causes an object to lose hexproof will cause an object to lose all �hexproof from [quality]� abilities. Any effect that allows a player to choose a creature with hexproof as a target as though it didn�t have hexproof will allow a player to choose a creature with a �hexproof from [quality]� ability. Any effect that looks for a card with hexproof will find a card with a �hexproof from [quality]� ability.

702.11f Multiple instances of the same hexproof ability on the same permanent or player are redundant.

702.12. Indestructible

702.12a Indestructible is a static ability.

702.12b A permanent with indestructible can�t be destroyed. Such permanents aren�t destroyed by lethal damage, and they ignore the state-based action that checks for lethal damage (see rule 704.5g).

702.12c Multiple instances of indestructible on the same permanent are redundant.

702.13. Intimidate

702.13a Intimidate is an evasion ability.

702.13b A creature with intimidate can�t be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or creatures that share a color with it. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.13c Multiple instances of intimidate on the same creature are redundant.

702.14. Landwalk

702.14a Landwalk is a generic term that appears within an object�s rules text as �[type]walk,� where [type] is usually a subtype, but can be the card type land, any land type, any supertype, or any combination thereof.

702.14b Landwalk is an evasion ability.

702.14c A creature with landwalk can�t be blocked as long as the defending player controls at least one land with the specified subtype (as in �islandwalk�), with the specified supertype (as in �legendary landwalk�), without the specified supertype (as in �nonbasic landwalk�), or with both the specified supertype and the specified subtype (as in �snow swampwalk�). (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.14d Landwalk abilities don�t �cancel� one another.
Example: If a player controls a snow Forest, that player can�t block an attacking creature with snow forestwalk even if they also control a creature with snow forestwalk.

702.14e Multiple instances of the same kind of landwalk on the same creature are redundant.

702.15. Lifelink

702.15a Lifelink is a static ability.

702.15b Damage dealt by a source with lifelink causes that source�s controller, or its owner if it has no controller, to gain that much life (in addition to any other results that damage causes). See rule 119.3.

702.15c If a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known information is used to determine whether it had lifelink.

702.15d The lifelink rules function no matter what zone an object with lifelink deals damage from.

702.15e If multiple sources with lifelink deal damage at the same time, they cause separate life gain events (see rule 118.9).
Example: A player controls Ajani�s Pridemate, which reads �Whenever you gain life, you may put a +1/+1 counter on Ajani�s Pridemate,� and two creatures with lifelink. The creatures with lifelink deal combat damage simultaneously. Ajani�s Pridemate�s ability triggers twice.

702.15f Multiple instances of lifelink on the same object are redundant.

702.16. Protection

702.16a Protection is a static ability, written �Protection from [quality].� This quality is usually a color (as in �protection from black�) but can be any characteristic value or information. If the quality happens to be a card name, it is treated as such only if the protection ability specifies that the quality is a name. If the quality is a card type, subtype, or supertype, the ability applies to sources that are permanents with that card type, subtype, or supertype and to any sources not on the battlefield that are of that card type, subtype, or supertype. This is an exception to rule 109.2.

702.16b A permanent or player with protection can�t be targeted by spells with the stated quality and can�t be targeted by abilities from a source with the stated quality.

702.16c A permanent or player with protection can�t be enchanted by Auras that have the stated quality. Such Auras attached to the permanent or player with protection will be put into their owners� graveyards as a state-based action. (See rule 704, �State-Based Actions.�)

702.16d A permanent with protection can�t be equipped by Equipment that have the stated quality or fortified by Fortifications that have the stated quality. Such Equipment or Fortifications become unattached from that permanent as a state-based action, but remain on the battlefield. (See rule 704, �State-Based Actions.�)

702.16e Any damage that would be dealt by sources that have the stated quality to a permanent or player with protection is prevented.

702.16f Attacking creatures with protection can�t be blocked by creatures that have the stated quality.

702.16g �Protection from [quality A] and from [quality B]� is shorthand for �protection from [quality A]� and �protection from [quality B]�; it behaves as two separate protection abilities. If an effect causes an object with such an ability to lose protection from [quality A], for example, that object would still have protection from [quality B].

702.16h �Protection from all [characteristic]� is shorthand for �protection from [quality A],� �protection from [quality B],� and so on for each possible quality the listed characteristic could have; it behaves as multiple separate protection abilities. If an effect causes an object with such an ability to lose protection from [quality A], for example, that object would still have protection from [quality B], [quality C], and so on.

702.16i �Protection from everything� is a variant of the protection ability. A permanent with protection from everything has protection from each object regardless of that object�s characteristic values. Such a permanent can�t be targeted by spells or abilities, enchanted by Auras, equipped by Equipment, fortified by Fortifications, or blocked by creatures, and all damage that would be dealt to it is prevented.

702.16j �Protection from [a player]� is a variant of the protection ability. A permanent with protection from a specific player has protection from each object the player controls and protection from each object the player owns not controlled by another player, regardless of that object�s characteristic values. Such a permanent can�t be targeted by spells or abilities the player controls, enchanted by Auras the player controls, equipped by Equipment the player controls, fortified by Fortifications the player controls, or blocked by creatures the player controls, and all damage that would be dealt to it by sources controlled by the player or owned by the player but not controlled by another player is prevented.

702.16k Multiple instances of protection from the same quality on the same permanent or player are redundant.

702.16m Some Auras both give the enchanted creature protection and say �this effect doesn�t remove� either that specific Aura or all Auras. This means that the specified Auras can legally enchant that creature and aren�t put into their owners� graveyards as a state-based action. If the creature has other instances of protection from the same quality, those instances affect Auras as normal.

702.17. Reach

702.17a Reach is a static ability.

702.17b A creature with flying can�t be blocked except by creatures with flying and/or reach. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step,� and rule 702.9, �Flying.�)

702.17c Multiple instances of reach on the same creature are redundant.

702.18. Shroud

702.18a Shroud is a static ability. �Shroud� means �This permanent or player can�t be the target of spells or abilities.�

702.18b Multiple instances of shroud on the same permanent or player are redundant.

702.19. Trample

702.19a Trample is a static ability that modifies the rules for assigning an attacking creature�s combat damage. The ability has no effect when a creature with trample is blocking or is dealing noncombat damage. (See rule 510, �Combat Damage Step.�)

702.19b The controller of an attacking creature with trample first assigns damage to the creature(s) blocking it. Once all those blocking creatures are assigned lethal damage, any remaining damage is assigned as its controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player or planeswalker the creature is attacking. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that�s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that�s actually dealt. The attacking creature�s controller need not assign lethal damage to all those blocking creatures but in that case can�t assign any damage to the player or planeswalker it�s attacking.
Example: A 2/2 creature that can block an additional creature blocks two attackers: a 1/1 with no abilities and a 3/3 with trample. The active player could assign 1 damage from the first attacker and 1 damage from the second to the blocking creature, and 2 damage to the defending player from the creature with trample.
Example: A 6/6 green creature with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature with protection from green. The attacking creature�s controller must assign at least 2 damage to the blocker, even though that damage will be prevented by the blocker�s protection ability. The attacking creature�s controller can divide the rest of the damage as they choose between the blocking creature and the defending player.

702.19c If an attacking creature with trample is blocked, but there are no creatures blocking it when damage is assigned, all its damage is assigned to the player or planeswalker it�s attacking.

702.19d If a creature with trample is attacking a planeswalker, none of its combat damage can be assigned to the defending player, even if that planeswalker has been removed from combat or the damage the attacking creature could assign is greater than the planeswalker�s loyalty.

702.19e Multiple instances of trample on the same creature are redundant.

702.20. Vigilance

702.20a Vigilance is a static ability that modifies the rules for the declare attackers step.

702.20b Attacking doesn�t cause creatures with vigilance to tap. (See rule 508, �Declare Attackers Step.�)

702.20c Multiple instances of vigilance on the same creature are redundant.

702.21. Banding

702.21a Banding is a static ability that modifies the rules for combat.

702.21b �Bands with other� is a special form of banding. If an effect causes a permanent to lose banding, the permanent loses all �bands with other� abilities as well.

702.21c As a player declares attackers, they may declare that one or more attacking creatures with banding and up to one attacking creature without banding (even if it has �bands with other�) are all in a �band.� They may also declare that one or more attacking [quality] creatures with �bands with other [quality]� and any number of other attacking [quality] creatures are all in a band. A player may declare as many attacking bands as they want, but each creature may be a member of only one of them. (Defending players can�t declare bands but may use banding in a different way; see rule 702.21j.)

702.21d All creatures in an attacking band must attack the same player or planeswalker.

702.21e Once an attacking band has been announced, it lasts for the rest of combat, even if something later removes banding or �bands with other� from one or more of the creatures in the band.

702.21f An attacking creature that�s removed from combat is also removed from the band it was in.

702.21g Banding doesn�t cause attacking creatures to share abilities, nor does it remove any abilities. The attacking creatures in a band are separate permanents.

702.21h If an attacking creature becomes blocked by a creature, each other creature in the same band as the attacking creature becomes blocked by that same blocking creature.
Example: A player attacks with a band consisting of a creature with flying and a creature with swampwalk. The defending player, who controls a Swamp, can block the flying creature if able. If they do, then the creature with swampwalk will also become blocked by the blocking creature(s).

702.21i If one member of a band would become blocked due to an effect, the entire band becomes blocked.

702.21j During the combat damage step, if an attacking creature is being blocked by a creature with banding, or by both a [quality] creature with �bands with other [quality]� and another [quality] creature, the defending player (rather than the active player) chooses how the attacking creature�s damage is assigned. That player can divide that creature�s combat damage as they choose among any number of creatures blocking it. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 510.1c.

702.21k During the combat damage step, if a blocking creature is blocking a creature with banding, or both a [quality] creature with �bands with other [quality]� and another [quality] creature, the active player (rather than the defending player) chooses how the blocking creature�s damage is assigned. That player can divide that creature�s combat damage as they choose among any number of creatures it�s blocking. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 510.1d.

702.21m Multiple instances of banding on the same creature are redundant. Multiple instances of �bands with other� of the same kind on the same creature are redundant.

702.22. Rampage

702.22a Rampage is a triggered ability. �Rampage N� means �Whenever this creature becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of turn for each creature blocking it beyond the first.� (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.22b The rampage bonus is calculated only once per combat, when the triggered ability resolves. Adding or removing blockers later in combat won�t change the bonus.

702.22c If a creature has multiple instances of rampage, each triggers separately.

702.23. Cumulative Upkeep

702.23a Cumulative upkeep is a triggered ability that imposes an increasing cost on a permanent. �Cumulative upkeep [cost]� means �At the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent is on the battlefield, put an age counter on this permanent. Then you may pay [cost] for each age counter on it. If you don�t, sacrifice it.� If [cost] has choices associated with it, each choice is made separately for each age counter, then either the entire set of costs is paid, or none of them is paid. Partial payments aren�t allowed.
Example: A creature has �Cumulative upkeep {W} or {U}� and two age counters on it. When its ability next triggers and resolves, the creature�s controller puts an age counter on it and then may pay {W}{W}{W}, {W}{W}{U}, {W}{U}{U}, or {U}{U}{U} to keep the creature on the battlefield.
Example: A creature has �Cumulative upkeep�Sacrifice a creature� and one age counter on it. When its ability next triggers and resolves, its controller can�t choose the same creature to sacrifice twice. Either two different creatures must be sacrificed, or the creature with cumulative upkeep must be sacrificed.

702.23b If a permanent has multiple instances of cumulative upkeep, each triggers separately. However, the age counters are not connected to any particular ability; each cumulative upkeep ability will count the total number of age counters on the permanent at the time that ability resolves.
Example: A creature has two instances of �Cumulative upkeep�Pay 1 life.� The creature has no age counters, and both cumulative upkeep abilities trigger. When the first ability resolves, the controller adds a counter and then chooses to pay 1 life. When the second ability resolves, the controller adds another counter and then chooses to pay an additional 2 life.

702.24. Flanking

702.24a Flanking is a triggered ability that triggers during the declare blockers step. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�) �Flanking� means �Whenever this creature becomes blocked by a creature without flanking, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.�

702.24b If a creature has multiple instances of flanking, each triggers separately.

702.25. Phasing

702.25a Phasing is a static ability that modifies the rules of the untap step. During each player�s untap step, before the active player untaps permanents, all phased-in permanents with phasing that player controls �phase out.� Simultaneously, all phased-out permanents that had phased out under that player�s control �phase in.�

702.25b If a permanent phases out, its status changes to �phased out.� Except for rules and effects that specifically mention phased-out permanents, a phased-out permanent is treated as though it does not exist. It can�t affect or be affected by anything else in the game. A permanent that phases out is removed from combat. (See rule 506.4.)
Example: You control three creatures, one of which is phased out. You cast a spell that says �Draw a card for each creature you control.� You draw two cards.
Example: You control a phased-out creature. You cast a spell that says �Destroy all creatures.� The phased-out creature is not destroyed.

702.25c If a permanent phases in, its status changes to �phased in.� The game once again treats it as though it exists.

702.25d The phasing event doesn�t actually cause a permanent to change zones or control, even though it�s treated as though it�s not on the battlefield and not under its controller�s control while it�s phased out. Zone-change triggers don�t trigger when a permanent phases in or out. Tokens continue to exist on the battlefield while phased out. Counters remain on a permanent while it�s phased out. Effects that check a phased-in permanent�s history won�t treat the phasing event as having caused the permanent to leave or enter the battlefield or its controller�s control.

702.25e Continuous effects that affect a phased-out permanent may expire while that permanent is phased out. If so, they will no longer affect that permanent once it�s phased in. In particular, effects with �for as long as� durations that track that permanent (see rule 611.2b) end when that permanent phases out because they can no longer see it.

702.25f When a permanent phases out, any Auras, Equipment, or Fortifications attached to that permanent phase out at the same time. This alternate way of phasing out is known as phasing out �indirectly.� An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out indirectly won�t phase in by itself, but instead phases in along with the permanent it�s attached to.

702.25g If an object would simultaneously phase out directly and indirectly, it just phases out indirectly.

702.25h An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out directly will phase in attached to the object or player it was attached to when it phased out, if that object is still in the same zone or that player is still in the game. If not, that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification phases in unattached. State-based actions apply as appropriate. (See rules 704.5m and 704.5n.)

702.25i Abilities that trigger when a permanent becomes attached or unattached from an object or player don�t trigger when that permanent phases in or out.

702.25j Phased-out permanents owned by a player who leaves the game also leave the game. This doesn�t trigger zone-change triggers. See rule 800.4.

702.25k If an effect causes a player to skip their untap step, the phasing event simply doesn�t occur that turn.

702.25m In a multiplayer game, game rules may cause a phased-out permanent to leave the game or to be exiled once a player leaves the game. (See rules 800.4a and 800.4c.) If a phased-out permanent phased out under the control of a player who has left the game, that permanent phases in during the next untap step after that player�s next turn would have begun.

702.25n Multiple instances of phasing on the same permanent are redundant.

702.26. Buyback

702.26a Buyback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities that function while the spell is on the stack. �Buyback [cost]� means �You may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell� and �If the buyback cost was paid, put this spell into its owner�s hand instead of into that player�s graveyard as it resolves.� Paying a spell�s buyback cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.27. Shadow

702.27a Shadow is an evasion ability.

702.27b A creature with shadow can�t be blocked by creatures without shadow, and a creature without shadow can�t be blocked by creatures with shadow. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.27c Multiple instances of shadow on the same creature are redundant.

702.28. Cycling

702.28a Cycling is an activated ability that functions only while the card with cycling is in a player�s hand. �Cycling [cost]� means �[Cost], Discard this card: Draw a card.�

702.28b Although the cycling ability can be activated only if the card is in a player�s hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with cycling will be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.

702.28c Some cards with cycling have abilities that trigger when they�re cycled. �When you cycle [this card]� means �When you discard [this card] to pay an activation cost of a cycling ability.� These abilities trigger from whatever zone the card winds up in after it�s cycled.

702.28d Some cards have abilities that trigger whenever a player �cycles or discards� a card. These abilities trigger only once when a card is cycled.

702.28e Typecycling is a variant of the cycling ability. �[Type]cycling [cost]� means �[Cost], Discard this card: Search your library for a [type] card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.� This type is usually a subtype (as in �mountaincycling�) but can be any card type, subtype, supertype, or combination thereof (as in �basic landcycling�).

702.28f Typecycling abilities are cycling abilities, and typecycling costs are cycling costs. Any cards that trigger when a player cycles a card will trigger when a card is discarded to pay an activation cost of a typecycling ability. Any effect that stops players from cycling cards will stop players from activating cards� typecycling abilities. Any effect that increases or reduces a cycling cost will increase or reduce a typecycling cost. Any effect that looks for a card with cycling will find a card with typecycling.

702.29. Echo

702.29a Echo is a triggered ability. �Echo [cost]� means �At the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent came under your control since the beginning of your last upkeep, sacrifice it unless you pay [cost].�

702.29b Urza block cards with the echo ability were printed without an echo cost. These cards have been given errata in the Oracle card reference; each one now has an echo cost equal to its mana cost.

702.30. Horsemanship

702.30a Horsemanship is an evasion ability.

702.30b A creature with horsemanship can�t be blocked by creatures without horsemanship. A creature with horsemanship can block a creature with or without horsemanship. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.30c Multiple instances of horsemanship on the same creature are redundant.

702.31. Fading

702.31a Fading is a keyword that represents two abilities. �Fading N� means �This permanent enters the battlefield with N fade counters on it� and �At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from this permanent. If you can�t, sacrifice the permanent.�

702.32. Kicker

702.32a Kicker is a static ability that functions while the spell with kicker is on the stack. �Kicker [cost]� means �You may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell.� Paying a spell�s kicker cost(s) follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.32b The phrase �Kicker [cost 1] and/or [cost 2]� means the same thing as �Kicker [cost 1], kicker [cost 2].�

702.32c Multikicker is a variant of the kicker ability. �Multikicker [cost]� means �You may pay an additional [cost] any number of times as you cast this spell.� A multikicker cost is a kicker cost.

702.32d If a spell�s controller declares the intention to pay any of that spell�s kicker costs, that spell has been �kicked.� If a spell has two kicker costs or has multikicker, it may be kicked multiple times. See rule 601.2b.

702.32e Objects with kicker or multikicker have additional abilities that specify what happens if they are kicked. These abilities are linked to the kicker or multikicker abilities printed on that object: they can refer only to those specific kicker or multikicker abilities. See rule 607, �Linked Abilities.�

702.32f Objects with more than one kicker cost have abilities that each correspond to a specific kicker cost. They contain the phrases �if it was kicked with its [A] kicker� and �if it was kicked with its [B] kicker,� where A and B are the first and second kicker costs listed on the card, respectively. Each of those abilities is linked to the appropriate kicker ability.

702.32g If part of a spell�s ability has its effect only if that spell was kicked, and that part of the ability includes any targets, the spell�s controller chooses those targets only if that spell was kicked. Otherwise, the spell is cast as if it did not have those targets. See rule 601.2c.

702.33. Flashback

702.33a Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player�s graveyard and another that functions while the card is on the stack. �Flashback [cost]� means �You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost� and �If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.� Casting a spell using its flashback ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.34. Madness

702.34a Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card with madness is in a player�s hand. The second is a triggered ability that functions when the first ability is applied. �Madness [cost]� means �If a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but exiles it instead of putting it into their graveyard� and �When this card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn�t, they put this card into their graveyard.�

702.34b Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.34c After resolving a madness triggered ability, if the exiled card wasn�t cast and was moved to a public zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that card. See rule 400.7i.

702.35. Fear

702.35a Fear is an evasion ability.

702.35b A creature with fear can�t be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.35c Multiple instances of fear on the same creature are redundant.

702.36. Morph

702.36a Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it�s on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. �Morph [cost]� means �You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost.� (See rule 707, �Face-Down Spells and Permanents.�)

702.36b Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability. �Megamorph [cost]� means �You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost� and �As this permanent is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on it if its megamorph cost was paid to turn it face up.� A megamorph cost is a morph cost.

702.36c To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card�s characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object�s characteristics. (See rule 613, �Interaction of Continuous Effects,� and rule 706, �Copying Objects.�) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use a morph ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally play it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.

702.36d You can�t normally cast a card face down. A morph ability allows you to do so.

702.36e Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control with a morph ability face up. This is a special action; it doesn�t use the stack (see rule 115). To do this, show all players what the permanent�s morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn�t have a morph cost if it were face up, it can�t be turned face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don�t trigger when it�s turned face up and don�t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.

702.36f If a permanent�s morph cost includes X, other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X chosen as the morph special action was taken.

702.36g See rule 707, �Face-Down Spells and Permanents,� for more information about how to cast cards with a morph ability.

702.37. Amplify

702.37a Amplify is a static ability. �Amplify N� means �As this object enters the battlefield, reveal any number of cards from your hand that share a creature type with it. This permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it for each card revealed this way. You can�t reveal this card or any other cards that are entering the battlefield at the same time as this card.�

702.37b If a creature has multiple instances of amplify, each one works separately.

702.38. Provoke

702.38a Provoke is a triggered ability. �Provoke� means �Whenever this creature attacks, you may choose to have target creature defending player controls block this creature this combat if able. If you do, untap that creature.�

702.38b If a creature has multiple instances of provoke, each triggers separately.

702.39. Storm

702.39a Storm is a triggered ability that functions on the stack. �Storm� means �When you cast this spell, copy it for each other spell that was cast before it this turn. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for any of the copies.�

702.39b If a spell has multiple instances of storm, each triggers separately.

702.40. Affinity

702.40a Affinity is a static ability that functions while the spell with affinity is on the stack. �Affinity for [text]� means �This spell costs you {1} less to cast for each [text] you control.�

702.40b If a spell has multiple instances of affinity, each of them applies.

702.41. Entwine

702.41a Entwine is a static ability of modal spells (see rule 700.2) that functions while the spell is on the stack. �Entwine [cost]� means �You may choose all modes of this spell instead of just one. If you do, you pay an additional [cost].� Using the entwine ability follows the rules for choosing modes and paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.41b If the entwine cost was paid, follow the text of each of the modes in the order written on the card when the spell resolves.

702.42. Modular

702.42a Modular represents both a static ability and a triggered ability. �Modular N� means �This permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it� and �When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact creature for each +1/+1 counter on this permanent.�

702.42b If a creature has multiple instances of modular, each one works separately.

702.43. Sunburst

702.43a Sunburst is a static ability that functions as an object is entering the battlefield from the stack. �Sunburst� means �If this object is entering the battlefield from the stack as a creature, it enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it. If this object is entering the battlefield from the stack and isn�t entering the battlefield as a creature, it enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.�

702.43b Sunburst applies only as the spell is resolving and only if one or more colored mana was spent on its costs. Mana paid for additional or alternative costs applies.

702.43c Sunburst can also be used to set a variable number for another ability. If the keyword is used in this way, it doesn�t matter whether the ability is on a creature spell or on a noncreature spell.
Example: The ability �Modular�Sunburst� means �This permanent enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it� and �When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact creature for each +1/+1 counter on this permanent.�

702.43d If an object has multiple instances of sunburst, each one works separately.

702.44. Bushido

702.44a Bushido is a triggered ability. �Bushido N� means �Whenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of turn.� (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.44b If a creature has multiple instances of bushido, each triggers separately.

702.45. Soulshift

702.45a Soulshift is a triggered ability. �Soulshift N� means �When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may return target Spirit card with converted mana cost N or less from your graveyard to your hand.�

702.45b If a permanent has multiple instances of soulshift, each triggers separately.

702.46. Splice

702.46a Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your hand. �Splice onto [subtype] [cost]� means �You may reveal this card from your hand as you cast a [subtype] spell. If you do, copy this card�s text box onto that spell and pay [cost] as an additional cost to cast that spell.� Paying a card�s splice cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.
Example: Since the card with splice remains in the player�s hand, it can later be cast normally or spliced onto another spell. It can even be discarded to pay a �discard a card� cost of the spell it�s spliced onto.

702.46b You can�t choose to use a splice ability if you can�t make the required choices (targets, etc.) for that card�s instructions. You can�t splice any one card onto the same spell more than once. If you�re splicing more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and choose the order in which their instructions will be followed. The instructions on the main spell have to be followed first.

702.46c The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the text boxes of each of the spliced cards. The spell doesn�t gain any other characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, card types, subtypes, etc.) of the spliced cards. Text copied onto the spell that refers to a card by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from which the text was copied.
Example: Glacial Ray is a red card with splice onto Arcane that reads, �Glacial Ray deals 2 damage to any target.� Suppose Glacial Ray is spliced onto Reach Through Mists, a blue spell. The spell is still blue, and Reach Through Mists deals the damage. This means that the ability can target a creature with protection from red and deal 2 damage to that creature.

702.46d Choose targets for the added text normally (see rule 601.2c). Note that a spell with one or more targets won�t resolve if all of its targets are illegal on resolution.

702.46e The spell loses any splice changes once it leaves the stack for any reason.

702.47. Offering

702.47a Offering is a static ability that functions while the spell with offering is on the stack. �[Subtype] offering� means �As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice a [subtype] permanent. If you chose to pay the additional cost, this spell�s total cost is reduced by the sacrificed permanent�s mana cost, and you may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.�

702.47b You choose which permanent to sacrifice as you make choices for the spell (see rule 601.2b), and you sacrifice that permanent as you pay the total cost (see rule 601.2h).

702.47c Generic mana in the sacrificed permanent�s mana cost reduces generic mana in the spell�s total cost. Colored and colorless mana in the sacrificed permanent�s mana cost reduces mana of the same type in spell�s total cost, and any excess reduces that much generic mana in spell�s total cost.

702.48. Ninjutsu

702.48a Ninjutsu is an activated ability that functions only while the card with ninjutsu is in a player�s hand. �Ninjutsu [cost]� means �[Cost], Reveal this card from your hand, Return an unblocked attacking creature you control to its owner�s hand: Put this card onto the battlefield from your hand tapped and attacking.�

702.48b The card with ninjutsu remains revealed from the time the ability is announced until the ability leaves the stack.

702.48c A ninjutsu ability may be activated only while a creature on the battlefield is unblocked (see rule 509.1h). The creature with ninjutsu is put onto the battlefield unblocked. It will be attacking the same player or planeswalker as the creature that was returned to its owner�s hand.

702.48d Commander ninjutsu is a variant of the ninjutsu ability that also functions while the card with commander ninjutsu is in the command zone. �Commander ninjutsu [cost]� means �[Cost], Reveal this card from your hand or from the command zone, Return an unblocked attacking creature you control to its owner�s hand: Put this card onto the battlefield tapped and attacking.�

702.49. Epic

702.49a Epic represents two spell abilities, one of which creates a delayed triggered ability. �Epic� means �For the rest of the game, you can�t cast spells,� and �At the beginning of each of your upkeeps for the rest of the game, copy this spell except for its epic ability. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for the copy.� See rule 706.10.

702.49b A player can�t cast spells once a spell with epic they control resolves, but effects (such as the epic ability itself) can still put copies of spells onto the stack.

702.50. Convoke

702.50a Convoke is a static ability that functions while the spell with convoke is on the stack. �Convoke� means �For each colored mana in this spell�s total cost, you may tap an untapped creature of that color you control rather than pay that mana. For each generic mana in this spell�s total cost, you may tap an untapped creature you control rather than pay that mana.�

702.50b The convoke ability isn�t an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with convoke is determined.
Example: Heartless Summoning says, in part, �Creature spells you cast cost {2} less to cast.� You control Heartless Summoning and cast Siege Wurm, a spell with convoke that costs {5}{G}{G}. The total cost to cast Siege Wurm is {3}{G}{G}. After activating mana abilities, you pay that total cost. You may tap up to two green creatures and up to three other creatures to pay that cost, and the remainder is paid with mana.

702.50c Multiple instances of convoke on the same spell are redundant.

702.51. Dredge

702.51a Dredge is a static ability that functions only while the card with dredge is in a player�s graveyard. �Dredge N� means �As long as you have at least N cards in your library, if you would draw a card, you may instead put N cards from the top of your library into your graveyard and return this card from your graveyard to your hand.�

702.51b A player with fewer cards in their library than the number required by a dredge ability can�t put any of them into their graveyard this way.

702.52. Transmute

702.52a Transmute is an activated ability that functions only while the card with transmute is in a player�s hand. �Transmute [cost]� means �[Cost], Discard this card: Search your library for a card with the same converted mana cost as the discarded card, reveal that card, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.�

702.52b Although the transmute ability can be activated only if the card is in a player�s hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with transmute will be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.

702.53. Bloodthirst

702.60c Multiple instances of split second on the same spell are redundant.

702.61. Suspend

The second and third are triggered abilities that function in the exile zone. �Suspend N�[cost]� means �If you could begin to cast this card by putting it onto the stack from your hand, you may pay [cost] and exile it with N time counters on it. This action doesn�t use the stack,� and �At the beginning of your upkeep, if this card is suspended, remove a time counter from it,� and �When the last time counter is removed from this card, if it�s exiled, play it without paying its mana cost if able.

702.61d Casting a spell as an effect of its suspend ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.62. Vanishing

702.76b Although the reinforce ability can be activated only if the card is in a player�s hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with reinforce will be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.

702.95b If a player chooses to pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell won�t require any targets. It may affect objects that couldn�t be chosen as legal targets if the spell were cast without its overload cost being paid.

702.98b The term �encoded� describes the relationship between the card with cipher while in the exile zone and the creature chosen when the spell represented by that card resolves.

702.98c The card with cipher remains encoded on the chosen creature as long as the card with cipher remains exiled and the creature remains on the battlefield. The card remains encoded on that object even if it changes controller or stops being a creature, as long as it remains on the battlefield.

702.99a Evolve is a triggered ability. �Evolve� means �Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature�s power is greater than this creature�s power and/or that creature�s toughness is greater than this creature�s toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.�

702.101. Fuse

702.101a Fuse is a static ability found on some split cards (see rule 708, �Split Cards�) that applies while the card with fuse is in a player�s hand. If a player casts a split card with fuse from their hand, the player may choose to cast both halves of that split card rather than choose one half. This choice is made before putting the split card with fuse onto the stack. The resulting spell is a fused split spell.

702.101b A fused split spell has the combined characteristics of its two halves. (See rule 708.4.)

702.101c The total cost of a fused split spell includes the mana cost of each half.

702.101d As a fused split spell resolves, the controller of the spell follows the instructions of the left half and then follows the instructions of the right half.

702.102. Bestow

702.102a Bestow represents two static abilities, one that functions while the card with bestow is on the stack and another that functions both while it�s on the stack and while it�s on the battlefield. �Bestow [cost]� means �You may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost.� and �If you chose to pay this spell�s bestow cost, it becomes an Aura enchantment and gains enchant creature. These effects last until one of two things happens: this spell has an illegal target as it resolves or the permanent this spell becomes, becomes unattached.� Paying a card�s bestow cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.102b If a spell�s controller chooses to pay its bestow cost, that player chooses a legal target for that Aura spell as defined by its enchant creature ability and rule 601.2c. See also rule 303.4.

702.102c The check for whether a spell can legally be cast happens after its controller has chosen whether to pay its bestow cost; see rule 601.2e.
Example: Aether Storm is an enchantment with the ability �Creature spells can�t be cast.� This effect doesn�t stop a creature card with bestow from being cast for its bestow cost because the spell is an Aura enchantment spell, not an enchantment creature spell, when the game checks whether the spell is illegal.

702.102d As an Aura spell with bestow begins resolving, if its target is illegal, the effect making it an Aura spell ends. It continues resolving as a creature spell and will be put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell�s controller. This is an exception to rule 608.3a.

702.102e If an Aura with bestow is attached to an illegal object or player, it becomes unattached. This is an exception to rule 704.5m.

702.103. Tribute

702.104. Dethrone

702.104a Dethrone is a triggered ability. �Dethrone� means �Whenever this creature attacks the player with the most life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.�

702.104b If a creature has multiple instances of dethrone, each triggers separately.

702.105. Hidden Agenda

702.105a Hidden agenda is a static ability that functions as a conspiracy card with hidden agenda is put into the command zone. �Hidden agenda� means �As you put this conspiracy card into the command zone, turn it face down and secretly choose a card name.�

702.105b To secretly choose a card name, note that name on a piece of paper kept with the face-down conspiracy card.

702.105c Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down conspiracy card you control in the command zone face up. This is a special action. Doing so will reveal the chosen name. See rule 115.2h.

702.105d Hidden agenda and another ability of the object with hidden agenda that refers to �the chosen name� are linked. The second ability refers only to the card name chosen as a result of that object�s hidden agenda ability. See rule 607.2d.

702.105e If a player leaves the game, all face-down conspiracy cards controlled by that player must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down conspiracy cards must be revealed to all players.

702.105f Double agenda is a variant of the hidden agenda ability. As you put a conspiracy card with double agenda into the command zone, you secretly name two different cards rather than one. You don�t reveal that more than one name was secretly chosen until you reveal the chosen names.

702.108a Dash represents three abilities: two static abilities that function while the card with dash is on the stack, one of which may create a delayed triggered ability, and a static ability that functions while the object with dash is on the battlefield. �Dash [cost]� means �You may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost,� �If this spell�s dash cost was paid, return the permanent this spell becomes to its owner�s hand at the beginning of the next end step,� and �As long as this permanent�s dash cost was paid, it has haste.� Paying a card�s dash cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.109. Exploit

702.109a Exploit is a triggered ability. �Exploit� means �When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature.�

702.109b A creature with exploit �exploits a creature� when the controller of the exploit ability sacrifices a creature as that ability resolves.

702.110. Menace

702.110a Menace is an evasion ability.

702.110b A creature with menace can�t be blocked except by two or more creatures. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.110c Multiple instances of menace on the same creature are redundant.

702.111. Renown

702.111a Renown is a triggered ability. �Renown N� means �When this creature deals combat damage to a player, if it isn�t renowned, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned.�

702.111b Renowned is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the renown ability and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become renowned. Once a permanent becomes renowned, it stays renowned until it leaves the battlefield. Renowned is neither an ability nor part of the permanent�s copiable values.

702.111c If a creature has multiple instances of renown, each triggers separately. The first such ability to resolve will cause the creature to become renowned, and subsequent abilities will have no effect. (See rule 603.4)

702.112. Awaken

702.112a Awaken appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two abilities: a static ability that functions while the spell with awaken is on the stack and a spell ability. �Awaken N�[cost]� means �You may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell�s mana cost as you cast this spell� and �If this spell�s awaken cost was paid, put N +1/+1 counters on target land you control. That land becomes a 0/0 Elemental creature with haste. It�s still a land.� Paying a spell�s awaken cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.112b The controller of a spell with awaken chooses the target of the awaken spell ability only if that player chose to pay the spell�s awaken cost. Otherwise the spell is cast as if it didn�t have that target.

702.113. Devoid

702.113a Devoid is a characteristic-defining ability. �Devoid� means �This object is colorless.� This ability functions everywhere, even outside the game. See rule 604.3.

702.114. Ingest

702.114a Ingest is a triggered ability. �Ingest� means �Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, that player exiles the top card of their library.�

702.114b If a creature has multiple instances of ingest, each triggers separately.

702.115. Myriad

702.115a Myriad is a triggered ability that may also create a delayed triggered ability. �Myriad� means �Whenever this creature attacks, for each opponent other than defending player, you may create a token that�s a copy of this creature that�s tapped and attacking that player or a planeswalker they control. If one or more tokens are created this way, exile the tokens at end of combat.�

702.115b If a creature has multiple instances of myriad, each triggers separately.

702.116. Surge

702.116a Surge is a static ability that functions while the spell with surge is on the stack. �Surge [cost]� means �You may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell�s mana cost as you cast this spell if you or one of your teammates has cast another spell this turn.� Paying a spell�s surge cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.117. Skulk

702.117a Skulk is an evasion ability.

702.117b A creature with skulk can�t be blocked by creatures with greater power. (See rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�)

702.117c Multiple instances of skulk on the same creature are redundant.

702.118. Emerge

702.118a Emerge represents two static abilities that function while the spell with emerge is on the stack. �Emerge [cost]� means �You may cast this spell by paying [cost] and sacrificing a creature rather than paying its mana cost� and �If you chose to pay this spell�s emerge cost, its total cost is reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to the sacrificed creature�s converted mana cost.� Paying a card�s emerge cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f�h.

702.118b You choose which creature to sacrifice as you choose to pay a spell�s emerge cost (see rule 601.2b), and you sacrifice that creature as you pay the total cost (see rule 601.2h).

702.119. Escalate

702.119a Escalate is a static ability of modal spells (see rule 700.2) that functions while the spell with escalate is on the stack. �Escalate [cost]� means �For each mode you choose beyond the first as you cast this spell, you pay an additional [cost].� Paying a spell�s escalate cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2f�h.

702.120. Melee

702.120a Melee is a triggered ability. �Melee� means �Whenever this creature attacks, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each opponent you attacked with a creature this combat.�

702.120b If a creature has multiple instances of melee, each triggers separately.

702.121. Crew

702.121a Crew is an activated ability of Vehicle cards. �Crew N� means �Tap any number of untapped creatures you control with total power N or greater: This permanent becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.�

702.121b A creature �crews a Vehicle� when it�s tapped to pay the cost to activate a Vehicle�s crew ability.

702.121c If an effect states that a creature �can�t crew Vehicles,� that creature can�t be tapped to pay the crew cost of a Vehicle.

702.122. Fabricate

702.122a Fabricate is a triggered ability. �Fabricate N� means �When this permanent enters the battlefield, you may put N +1/+1 counters on it. If you don�t, create N 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature tokens.�

702.122b If a permanent has multiple instances of fabricate, each triggers separately.

702.123. Partner

702.123a Partner is an ability that modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant (see rule 903), and it functions before the game begins. Rather than a single legendary creature card, you may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander if each has partner.

702.123b Your deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its two commanders. Both commanders begin the game in the command zone.

702.123c A rule or effect that refers to your commander�s color identity refers to the combined color identities of your two commanders. See rule 903.4.

702.123d Except for determining the color identity of your commander, the two commanders function independently. When casting a commander with partner, ignore how many times your other commander has been cast. When determining whether a player has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander, consider damage from each of your two commanders separately. See rule 903.11a.

702.123e If an effect refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to either one. If an effect causes you to perform an action on your commander and it could affect both, you choose which it refers to at the time the effect is applied.

702.123f �Partner with [name]� is a variant of the partner ability. �Partner with [name]� represents two abilities. One is a static ability that modifies the rules for deck construction. Rather than a single legendary creature card, you may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander if each has a �partner with [name]� ability with the other�s name. You can�t designate two legendary cards as your commander if one has a �partner with [name]� ability and the other isn�t the named card. The other ability represented by �partner with [name]� is a triggered ability that means �When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library.�

702.124. Undaunted

702.124a Undaunted is a static ability that functions while the spell with undaunted is on the stack. Undaunted means �This spell costs {1} less to cast for each opponent you have.�

702.124b Players who have left the game are not counted when determining how many opponents you have.

702.124c If a spell has multiple instances of undaunted, each of them applies.

702.125. Improvise

702.125a Improvise is a static ability that functions while the spell with improvise is on the stack. �Improvise� means �For each generic mana in this spell�s total cost, you may tap an untapped artifact you control rather than pay that mana.�

702.125b The improvise ability isn�t an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with improvise is determined.

702.125c Multiple instances of improvise on the same spell are redundant.

702.126. Aftermath

702.126a Aftermath is an ability found on some split cards (see rule 708, �Split Cards�). It represents three static abilities. �Aftermath� means �You may cast this half of this split card from your graveyard,� �This half of this split card can�t be cast from any zone other than a graveyard,� and �If this spell was cast from a graveyard, exile it instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.�

702.127. Embalm

702.127a Embalm is an activated ability that functions while the card with embalm is in a graveyard. �Embalm [cost]� means �[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that�s a copy of this card, except it�s white, it has no mana cost, and it�s a Zombie in addition to its other types. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.�

702.127b A token is �embalmed� if it�s created by a resolving embalm ability.

702.128. Eternalize

702.128a Eternalize is an activated ability that functions while the card with eternalize is in a graveyard. �Eternalize [cost]� means �[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that�s a copy of this card, except it�s black, it�s 4/4, it has no mana cost, and it�s a Zombie in addition to its other types. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.�

702.129. Afflict

702.129a Afflict is a triggered ability. �Afflict N� means �Whenever this creature becomes blocked, defending player loses N life.�

702.129b If a creature has multiple instances of afflict, each triggers separately.

703. Turn-Based Actions

703.1. Turn-based actions are game actions that happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin, or when each step and phase ends. Turn-based actions don�t use the stack.

703.1a Abilities that watch for a specified step or phase to begin are triggered abilities, not turn-based actions. (See rule 603, �Handling Triggered Abilities.�)

703.2. Turn-based actions are not controlled by any player.

703.3. Whenever a step or phase begins, if it�s a step or phase that has any turn-based action associated with it, those turn-based actions are automatically dealt with first. This happens before state-based actions are checked, before triggered abilities are put on the stack, and before players receive priority.

703.4. The turn-based actions are as follows:

703.4a Immediately after the untap step begins, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all phased-out permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase in. This all happens simultaneously. See rule 502.1.

703.4b Immediately after the phasing action has been completed during the untap step, the active player determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them all simultaneously. See rule 502.2.

703.4c Immediately after the draw step begins, the active player draws a card. See rule 504.1.

703.4d In an Archenemy game (see rule 904), immediately after the archenemy�s precombat main phase begins, that player sets the top card of his or her scheme deck in motion. See rule 701.23.

703.4e Immediately after the beginning of combat step begins, if the game being played is a multiplayer game in which the active player�s opponents don�t all automatically become defending players, the active player chooses one of his or her opponents. That player becomes the defending player. See rule 507.1.

703.4f Immediately after the declare attackers step begins, the active player declares attackers. See rule 508.1.

703.4g Immediately after the declare blockers step begins, the defending player declares blockers. See rule 509.1.

703.4h Immediately after blockers have been declared during the declare blockers step, for each attacking creature that�s become blocked by multiple creatures, the active player announces the damage assignment order among the blocking creatures. See rule 509.2.

703.4i Immediately after the active player has announced damage assignment orders (if necessary) during the declare blockers step, for each creature that�s blocking multiple creatures, the defending player announces the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures. See rule 509.3.

703.4j Immediately after the combat damage step begins, each player in APNAP order announces how each attacking or blocking creature he or she controls assigns its combat damage. See rule 510.1.

703.4k Immediately after combat damage has been assigned during the combat damage step, all combat damage is dealt simultaneously. See rule 510.2.

703.4m Immediately after the cleanup step begins, if the active player�s hand contains more cards than his or her maximum hand size (normally seven), he or she discards enough cards to reduce his or her hand size to that number. See rule 514.1.

703.4n Immediately after the active player has discarded cards (if necessary) during the cleanup step, all damage is removed from permanents and all �until end of turn� and �this turn� effects end. These actions happen simultaneously. See rule 514.2.

703.4p When each step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a player�s mana pool empties. See rule 500.4.

704. State-Based Actions

704.1. State-based actions are game actions that happen automatically whenever certain conditions (listed below) are met. State-based actions don�t use the stack.

704.1a Abilities that watch for a specified game state are triggered abilities, not state-based actions. (See rule 603, �Handling Triggered Abilities.�)

704.2. State-based actions are checked throughout the game and are not controlled by any player.

704.3. Whenever a player would get priority (see rule 116, �Timing and Priority�), the game checks for any of the listed conditions for state-based actions, then performs all applicable state-based actions simultaneously as a single event. If any state-based actions are performed as a result of a check, the check is repeated; otherwise all triggered abilities that are waiting to be put on the stack are put on the stack, then the check is repeated. Once no more state-based actions have been performed as the result of a check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, the appropriate player gets priority. This process also occurs during the cleanup step (see rule 514), except that if no state-based actions are performed as the result of the step�s first check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, then no player gets priority and the step ends.

704.4. Unlike triggered abilities, state-based actions pay no attention to what happens during the resolution of a spell or ability.
Example: A player controls a creature with the ability �This creature�s power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your hand� and casts a spell whose effect is �Discard your hand, then draw seven cards.� The creature will temporarily have toughness 0 in the middle of the spell�s resolution but will be back up to toughness 7 when the spell finishes resolving. Thus the creature will survive when state-based actions are checked. In contrast, an ability that triggers when the player has no cards in hand goes on the stack after the spell resolves, because its trigger event happened during resolution.

704.5. The state-based actions are as follows:

704.5a If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game.

704.5b If a player attempted to draw a card from a library with no cards in it since the last time state-based actions were checked, that player loses the game.

704.5c If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the game. Ignore this rule in Two-Headed Giant games; see rule 704.5t instead.

704.5d If a token is in a zone other than the battlefield, it ceases to exist.

704.5e If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist.

704.5f If a creature has toughness 0 or less, it�s put into its owner�s graveyard. Regeneration can�t replace this event.

704.5g If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and the total damage marked on it is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.

704.5h If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and it�s been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.

704.5i If a planeswalker has loyalty 0, it�s put into its owner�s graveyard.

704.5j If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners� graveyards. This is called the �legend rule.�

704.5k If two or more permanents have the supertype world, all except the one that has had the world supertype for the shortest amount of time are put into their owners� graveyards. In the event of a tie for the shortest amount of time, all are put into their owners� graveyards. This is called the �world rule.�

704.5m If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, or is not attached to an object or player, that Aura is put into its owner�s graveyard.

704.5n If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent. It remains on the battlefield.

704.5p If a creature is attached to an object or player, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield. Similarly, if a permanent that�s neither an Aura, an Equipment, nor a Fortification is attached to an object or player, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield.

704.5q If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it.

704.5r If a permanent with an ability that says it can�t have more than N counters of a certain kind on it has more than N counters of that kind on it, all but N of those counters are removed from it.

704.5s In a Two-Headed Giant game, if a team has 0 or less life, that team loses the game. See rule 810, �Two-Headed Giant Variant.�

704.5t In a Two-Headed Giant game, if a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. See rule 810, �Two-Headed Giant Variant.�

704.5u In a Commander game, a player that�s been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. See rule 903, �Commander.�

704.5v In an Archenemy game, if a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner�s scheme deck. See rule 904, �Archenemy.�

704.5w In a Planechase game, if a phenomenon card is face up in the command zone, and it isn�t the source of a triggered ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the planar controller planeswalks. See rule 901, �Planechase.�

704.6. If multiple state-based actions would have the same result at the same time, a single replacement effect will replace all of them.
Example: You control Lich�s Mirror, which says �If you would lose the game, instead shuffle your hand, your graveyard, and all permanents you own into your library, then draw seven cards and your life total becomes 20.� There�s one card in your library and your life total is 1. A spell causes you to draw two cards and lose 2 life. The next time state-based actions are checked, you�d lose the game due to rule 704.5a and rule 704.5b. Instead, Lich�s Mirror replaces that game loss and you keep playing.

704.7. If a state-based action results in a permanent leaving the battlefield at the same time other state-based actions were performed, that permanent�s last known information is derived from the game state before any of those state-based actions were performed.
Example: You control Young Wolf, a 1/1 creature with undying, and it has a +1/+1 counter on it. A spell puts three -1/-1 counters on Young Wolf. Before state-based actions are performed, Young Wolf has one +1/+1 counter and three -1/-1 counters on it. After state-based actions are performed, Young Wolf is in the graveyard. When it was last on the battlefield, it had a +1/+1 counter on it, so undying will not trigger.

705. Flipping a Coin

705.1. To flip a coin for an object that cares whether a player wins or loses the flip, the affected player flips the coin and calls �heads� or �tails.� If the call matches the result, that player wins the flip. Otherwise, the player loses the flip. Only the player who flips the coin wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.

705.2. To flip a coin for an object that cares whether the coin comes up heads or tails, each affected player flips a coin without making a call. No player wins or loses this kind of flip.

705.3. A coin used in a flip must be a two-sided object with easily distinguished sides and equal likelihood that either side lands face up. If the coin that�s being flipped doesn�t have an obvious �heads� or �tails,� designate one side to be �heads,� and the other side to be �tails.� Other methods of randomization may be substituted for flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal likelihood and all players agree to the substitution. For example, the player may roll an even-sided die and call �odds� or �evens,� or roll an even-sided die and designate that �odds� means �heads� and �evens� means �tails.�

706. Copying Objects

706.1. Some objects become or turn another object into a �copy� of a spell, permanent, or card. Some effects create a token that�s a copy of another object. (Certain older cards were printed with the phrase �search for a copy.� This section doesn�t cover those cards, which have received new text in the Oracle card reference.)

706.2. When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original object�s characteristics and, for an object on the stack, choices made when casting or activating it (mode, targets, the value of X, whether it was kicked, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on). The �copiable values� are the values derived from the text printed on the object (that text being name, mana cost, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, power, toughness, and/or loyalty), as modified by other copy effects, by its face-down status, and by �as . . . enters the battlefield� and �as . . . is turned face up� abilities that set power and toughness (and may also set additional characteristics). Other effects (including type-changing and text-changing effects), status, and counters are not copied.
Example: Chimeric Staff is an artifact that reads �{X}: Chimeric Staff becomes an X/X artifact creature until end of turn.� Clone is a creature that reads, �You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.� After a Staff has become a 5/5 artifact creature, a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of it. The Clone is an artifact, not a 5/5 artifact creature. (The copy has the Staff�s ability, however, and will become a creature if that ability is activated.)
Example: Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph {2}{B}{B}). The Clone is a colorless 2/2 creature with no name, no types, no abilities, and no mana cost. It will still be face up. Its controller can�t pay {2}{B}{B} to turn it face up.

706.2a A copy acquires the color of the object it�s copying because that value is derived from its mana cost or color indicator. A copy acquires the abilities of the object it�s copying because those values are derived from its rules text. A copy doesn�t wind up with two values of each ability (that is, it doesn�t copy the object�s abilities and its rules text, then have that rules text define a new set of abilities).

706.3. The copy�s copiable values become the copied information, as modified by the copy�s status (see rule 110.6). Objects that copy the object will use the new copiable values.
Example: Vesuvan Doppelganger reads, �You may have Vesuvan Doppelganger enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it doesn�t copy that creature�s color and it gains �At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have this creature become a copy of target creature, except it doesn�t copy that creature�s color. If you do, this creature gains this ability.�� A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear (a 2/2 green Bear creature with no abilities). Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Doppelganger. The Clone is a 2/2 blue Bear named Runeclaw Bear that has the Doppelganger�s upkeep-triggered ability.
Example: Tomoya the Revealer (a flipped flip card) becomes a copy of Nezumi Shortfang (an unflipped flip card). Tomoya�s characteristics become the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious, which is the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang.
Example: A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a copy of a face-up Branchsnap Lorian (a 4/1 green creature with trample and morph {G}). The Demon�s characteristics become the characteristics of Branchsnap Lorian. However, since the creature is face down, it remains a 2/2 colorless creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana cost. It can be turned face up for {G}. If it�s turned face up, it will have the characteristics of Branchsnap Lorian.
Example: A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a copy of Wandering Ones (a 1/1 blue Spirit creature that doesn�t have morph). It will be a face-down Wandering Ones. It remains a 2/2 colorless creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana cost. Its controller can�t turn it face up as a special action. If an effect turns it face up, it will have the characteristics of Wandering Ones.

706.4. Some effects cause a permanent that�s copying a permanent to copy a different object while remaining on the battlefield. The change doesn�t trigger enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities. This also doesn�t change any noncopy effects presently affecting the permanent.
Example: Unstable Shapeshifter reads, �Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature and gains this ability.� It�s affected by Giant Growth, which reads �Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.� If a creature enters the battlefield later this turn, Unstable Shapeshifter will become a copy of that creature, but it will still get +3/+3 from the Giant Growth.

706.5. An object that enters the battlefield �as a copy� or �that�s a copy� of another object becomes a copy as it enters the battlefield. It doesn�t enter the battlefield, and then become a copy of that permanent. If the text that�s being copied includes any abilities that replace the enters-the-battlefield event (such as �enters the battlefield with� or �as [this] enters the battlefield� abilities), those abilities will take effect. Also, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities of the copy will have a chance to trigger.
Example: Skyshroud Behemoth reads, �Fading 2 (This creature enters the battlefield with two fade counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from it. If you can�t, sacrifice it.)� and �Skyshroud Behemoth enters the battlefield tapped.� A Clone that enters the battlefield as a copy of a Skyshroud Behemoth will also enter the battlefield tapped with two fade counters on it.
Example: Wall of Omens reads, �When Wall of Omens enters the battlefield, draw a card.� A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Wall of Omens. The Clone has the Wall�s enters-the-battlefield triggered ability, so the Clone�s controller draws a card.

706.6. When copying a permanent, any choices that have been made for that permanent aren�t copied. Instead, if an object enters the battlefield as a copy of another permanent, the object�s controller will get to make any �as [this] enters the battlefield� choices for it.
Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Adaptive Automaton. Adaptive Automaton reads, in part, �As Adaptive Automaton enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.� The Clone won�t copy the creature type choice of the Automaton; rather, the controller of the Clone will get to make a new choice.

706.7. If a pair of linked abilities are copied, those abilities will be similarly linked to one another on the object that copied them. One ability refers only to actions that were taken or objects that were affected by the other. They can�t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the copy may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule 607, �Linked Abilities.�

706.7a If an ability causes a player to �choose a [value]� and a second, linked ability refers to that choice, the second ability is the only ability that can refer to that choice. An object doesn�t �remember� that choice and use it for other abilities it may copy later. If an object copies an ability that refers to a choice, but either (a) doesn�t copy that ability�s linked ability or (b) does copy the linked ability but no choice is made for it, then the choice is considered to be �undefined.� If an ability refers to an undefined choice, that part of the ability won�t do anything.
Example: Voice of All enters the battlefield and Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. Voice of All reads, in part, �As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.� and �Voice of All has protection from the chosen color.� Unstable Shapeshifter never had a chance for a color to be chosen for it, because it didn�t enter the battlefield as a Voice of All card, so the protection ability doesn�t protect it from anything at all.
Example: A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Voice of All, and the Doppelganger�s controller chooses blue. Later, the Doppelganger copies Quirion Elves, which has the ability, �{T}: Add one mana of the chosen color to your mana pool.� Even though a color was chosen for the Doppelganger, it wasn�t chosen for the ability linked to the mana ability copied from the Elves. If that mana ability of the Doppelganger is activated, it will not produce mana.

706.8. When copying a double-faced permanent, a face-up meld card, or a melded permanent, only the copiable values of the face that�s currently up are copied. (See rule 711, �Double-Faced Cards,� and rule 712, �Meld Cards.�)

706.9. Copy effects may include modifications or exceptions to the copying process.

706.9a Some copy effects cause the copy to gain an ability as part of the copying process. This ability becomes part of the copiable values for the copy, along with any other abilities that were copied.
Example: Quirion Elves enters the battlefield and an Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. The copiable values of the Shapeshifter now match those of the Elves, except that the Shapeshifter also has the ability �Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature and gains this ability.� Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Unstable Shapeshifter. The Clone copies the new copiable values of the Shapeshifter, including the ability that the Shapeshifter gave itself when it copied the Elves.

706.9b Some copy effects specifically state that they don�t copy certain characteristics and instead retain their original values. These effects use the phrase �except its [characteristic] is still [value]� or �except it�s still [value(s)].� They may also simply state that certain characteristics are not copied.

706.9c Some copy effects modify a characteristic as part of the copying process. The final value(s) for that characteristic becomes part of the copiable values for the copy.
Example: Copy Artifact is an enchantment that reads, �You may have Copy Artifact enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact on the battlefield, except it�s an enchantment in addition to its other types.� It enters the battlefield as a copy of Juggernaut. The copiable values of the Copy Artifact now match those of Juggernaut with one modification: its types are now artifact, creature, and enchantment.

706.9d When applying a copy effect that doesn�t copy a certain characteristic, retains an original value for a certain characteristic, or modifies the final value of a certain characteristic, any characteristic-defining ability (see rule 604.3) of the object being copied that defines that characteristic is not copied. If that characteristic is color, any color indicator (see rule 204) of that object is also not copied.
Example: Quicksilver Gargantuan is a creature that reads, �You may have Quicksilver Gargantuan enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it�s still 7/7.� Quicksilver Gargantuan enters the battlefield as a copy of Tarmogoyf, which has a characteristic-defining ability that defines its power and toughness. Quicksilver Gargantuan does not have that ability. It will be 7/7.

706.10. To copy a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability means to put a copy of it onto the stack; a copy of a spell isn�t cast and a copy of an activated ability isn�t activated. A copy of a spell or ability copies both the characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it, including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative costs. (See rule 601, �Casting Spells.�) Choices that are normally made on resolution are not copied. If an effect of the copy refers to objects used to pay its costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the original spell or ability. A copy of a spell is owned by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell or ability is controlled by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, even though it has no spell card associated with it. A copy of an ability is itself an ability.
Example: A player casts Fork, targeting an Emerald Charm. Fork reads, �Copy target instant or sorcery spell, except that the copy is red. You may choose new targets for the copy.� Emerald Charm is a green instant that reads, �Choose one � Untap target permanent; or destroy target non-Aura enchantment; or target creature loses flying until end of turn.� When the Fork resolves, it puts a copy of the Emerald Charm on the stack except the copy is red, not green. The copy has the same mode that was chosen for the original Emerald Charm. It does not necessarily have the same target, but only because Fork allows choosing of new targets.
Example: Fling is an instant that reads, �As an additional cost to cast Fling, sacrifice a creature� and �Fling deals damage equal to the sacrificed creature�s power to target creature or player.� When determining how much damage a copy of Fling deals, it checks the power of the creature sacrificed to pay for the original Fling.

706.10a If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist. These are state-based actions. See rule 704.

706.10b A copy of an ability has the same source as the original ability. If the ability refers to its source by name, the copy refers to that same object and not to any other object with the same name. The copy is considered to be the same ability by effects that count how many times that ability has resolved during the turn.

706.10c Some effects copy a spell or ability and state that its controller may choose new targets for the copy. The player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal. Once the player has decided what the copy�s targets will be, the copy is put onto the stack with those targets.

706.10d Some effects copy a spell or ability for each player or object it �could target.� The copies are put onto the stack with those targets in the order of their controller�s choice. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of its targets must be the same player or object. If that player or object isn�t a legal target for each instance of the word �target,� a copy isn�t created for that player or object.

706.11. If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks that permanent even if it changes names or becomes a copy of something else.
Example: An Unstable Shapeshifter copies a Crazed Armodon. Crazed Armodon reads, �{G}: Crazed Armodon gets +3/+0 and gains trample until end of turn. Destroy Crazed Armodon at the beginning of the next end step. Activate this ability only once each turn.� If this ability of the Shapeshifter is activated, the Shapeshifter will be destroyed at the beginning of the next end step, even if it�s no longer a copy of Crazed Armodon at that time.

706.12. An effect that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object (and not just copy a spell) follows the rules for casting spells, except that the copy is created in the same zone the object is in and then cast while another spell or ability is resolving. Casting a copy of an object follows steps 601.2a�h of rule 601, �Casting Spells,� and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.

707. Face-Down Spells and Permanents

707.1. Some cards allow spells and permanents to be face down.

707.2. Face-down spells and face-down permanents have no characteristics other than those listed by the ability or rules that allowed the spell or permanent to be face down. Any listed characteristics are the copiable values of that object�s characteristics. (See rule 613, �Interaction of Continuous Effects,� and rule 706, �Copying Objects.�)

707.2a If a face-up permanent is turned face down by a spell or ability, it becomes a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. A permanent that enters the battlefield face down that wasn�t cast as a face-down spell also has these characteristics. These values are the copiable values of that object�s characteristics.

707.3. Objects that are put onto the battlefield face down are turned face down before they enter the battlefield, so the permanent�s enters-the-battlefield abilities won�t trigger (if triggered) or have any effect (if static).

707.4. Objects that are cast face down are turned face down before they are put onto the stack, so effects that care about the characteristics of a spell will see only the face-down spell�s characteristics. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting an object with these characteristics (and not the face-up object�s characteristics) are applied to casting this object. The permanent the spell becomes will be a face-down permanent.

707.5. At any time, you may look at a face-down spell you control on the stack or a face-down permanent you control (even if it�s phased out). You can�t look at face-down cards in any other zone or face-down spells or permanents controlled by another player.

707.6. If you control multiple face-down spells or face-down permanents, you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other. This includes, but is not limited to, knowing what ability or rules caused the permanents to be face down, the order spells were cast, the order that face-down permanents entered the battlefield, which creature(s) attacked last turn, and any other differences between face-down spells or permanents. Common methods for distinguishing between face-down objects include using counters or dice to mark the different objects, or clearly placing those objects in order on the table.

707.7. The ability or rules that allow a permanent to be face down may also allow the permanent�s controller to turn it face up. Spells normally can�t be turned face up.

707.8. As a face-down permanent is turned face up, its copiable values revert to its normal copiable values. Any effects that have been applied to the face-down permanent still apply to the face-up permanent. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don�t trigger and don�t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.

707.9. If a face-down permanent moves from the battlefield to any other zone, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a face-down spell moves from the stack to any zone other than the battlefield, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a player leaves the game, all face-down permanents and spells owned by that player must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down permanents and spells must be revealed to all players.

707.10. If a face-down permanent becomes a copy of another permanent, its copiable values become the copiable values of that permanent, as modified by its face-down status. Its characteristics therefore remain the same: the characteristics listed by the ability or rules that allowed it to be turned face down. However, if it is turned face up, its copiable values become the values it copied from the other permanent. See rule 706.3.

707.11. If a face-down permanent would have an �As [this permanent] is turned face up . . .� ability after it�s turned face up, that ability is applied while that permanent is being turned face up, not afterward.

708. Split Cards

708.1. Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal Magic card back.

708.2. Although split cards have two castable halves, each split card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a split card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.

708.3. A player chooses which half of a split card they are casting before putting it onto the stack.

708.3a Only the chosen half is evaluated to see if it can be cast. Only that half is considered to be put onto the stack.

708.3b While on the stack, only the characteristics of the half being cast exist. The other half�s characteristics are treated as though they didn�t exist.

708.3c An effect may create a copy of a split card and allow a player to cast the copy. That copy retains the characteristics of the two halves separated into the same two halves as the original card. (See rule 706.12.)

708.4. In every zone except the stack, the characteristics of a split card are those of its two halves combined. This is a change from previous rules.

708.4a Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a split card�s name, the player must choose one of those names and not both. An object has the chosen name if one of its names is the chosen name.

708.4b The mana cost of a split card is the combined mana costs of its two halves. A split card�s colors and converted mana cost are determined from its combined mana cost.
Example: Assault/Battery�s mana cost is {3}{R}{G}. It�s a red and green card with a converted mana cost of 5. If you cast Assault, the resulting spell is a red spell with a converted mana cost of 1.

708.4c A split card has each card type specified on either of its halves and each ability in the text box of each half.

708.4d The characteristics of a fused split spell on the stack are also those of its two halves combined (see rule 702.101, �Fuse�).

709. Flip Cards

709.1. Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card. The text that appears right side up on the card defines the card�s normal characteristics. Additional alternative characteristics appear upside down on the card. The back of a flip card is the normal Magic card back.

709.1a The top half of a flip card contains the card�s normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. The text box usually contains an ability that causes the permanent to �flip� if certain conditions are met.

709.1b The bottom half of a flip card contains an alternative name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. These characteristics are used only if the permanent is on the battlefield and only if the permanent is flipped.

709.1c A flip card�s color and mana cost don�t change if the permanent is flipped. Also, any changes to it by external effects will still apply.

709.2. In every zone other than the battlefield, and also on the battlefield before the permanent flips, a flip card has only the normal characteristics of the card. Once a permanent is flipped, its normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness don�t apply and the alternative versions of those characteristics apply instead.
Example: Akki Lavarunner is a nonlegendary creature that flips into a legendary creature named Tok-Tok, Volcano Born. An effect that says �Search your library for a legendary card� can�t find this flip card. An effect that says �Legendary creatures get +2/+2� doesn�t affect Akki Lavarunner, but it does affect Tok-Tok.

709.3. You must ensure that it�s clear at all times whether a permanent you control is flipped or not, both when it�s untapped and when it�s tapped. Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped permanents include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.

709.4. Flipping a permanent is a one-way process. Once a permanent is flipped, it�s impossible for it to become unflipped. However, if a flipped permanent leaves the battlefield, it retains no memory of its status. See rule 110.6.

709.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a flip card�s alternative name, the player may do so.

710. Leveler Cards

710.1. Each leveler card has a striated text box and three power/toughness boxes. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols.

710.2. A level symbol is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as �N1-N2,� or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as �N3+.� Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that striation, indicated here as �[P/T].�

710.2a �{LEVEL N1-N2} [Abilities] [P/T]� means �As long as this creature has at least N1 level counters on it, but no more than N2 level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].�

710.2b �{LEVEL N3+} [Abilities] [P/T]� means �As long as this creature has N3 or more level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].�

710.3. The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which level symbol. Leveler cards each contain only one text box.

710.4. Any ability a leveler card has that isn�t preceded by a level symbol is treated normally. In particular, each leveler permanent has its level up ability (see rule 702.86) at all times; it may be activated regardless of how many level counters are on that permanent.

710.5. If the number of level counters on a leveler creature is less than N1 (the first number printed in its {LEVEL N1-N2} symbol), it has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.

710.6. In every zone other than the battlefield, a leveler card has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.

711. Double-Faced Cards

711.1. A double-faced card has a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. Each face may have abilities that allow the card to �transform,� or turn over to its other face. Tokens and cards with a Magic card back can�t transform. (See rule 701.26, �Transform.�)

711.1a A double-faced card�s front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left corner. On Magic Origins double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a modified Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistrad block and Shadows over Innistrad set, as well as on Ulrich of the Krallenhorde in the Eldritch Moon set, the front-face symbol is a sun. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a full moon. On Ixalan cards, the front-face symbol is a compass rose.

711.1b A double-faced card�s back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left corner. On Magic Origins double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a full Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistrad block and Shadows over Innistrad set, as well as on Ulrich, Uncontested Alpha in the Eldritch Moon set, the back-face symbol is a crescent moon. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a stylized image of Emrakul. On Ixalan cards, the back-face symbol is a land icon.

711.1c If the back face of a double-faced card is a creature, the front face of that card will have the back face�s power and toughness printed in gray above the power and toughness box. This is reminder text and has no effect on game play.

711.1d Meld cards have a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized Magic card face on the other. These aren�t double-faced cards and are subject to their own set of rules. See rule 712, �Meld Cards.�

711.2. Players who are allowed to look at a double-faced card may look at both faces.

711.3. Players must ensure that double-faced cards in hidden zones are indistinguishable from other cards in the same zone. To do this, the owner of a double-faced card may use completely opaque card sleeves or substitute a checklist card (see rule 713). Sanctioned tournaments have additional rules for playing with double-faced cards. See rule 100.6.

711.4. Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics.

711.4a While a double-faced card is outside the game, in a zone other than the battlefield, or on the battlefield with its front face up, it has only the characteristics of its front face.

711.4b While a double-faced permanent�s back face is up, it has only the characteristics of its back face. However, its converted mana cost is calculated using the mana cost of its front face. If a permanent is copying the back face of a double-faced card (even if the card representing that copy is itself a double-faced card), the converted mana cost of that permanent is 0.

711.5. Only permanents represented by double-faced cards can transform. (See rule 701.26, �Transform.�) If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform any permanent that isn�t represented by a double-faced card, nothing happens.
Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Wildblood Pack (the back face of a double-faced card). The Clone will be a copy of the Wildblood Pack. Because the Clone is itself not a double-faced card, it can�t transform.
Example: A player casts Cytoshape, causing a Kruin Outlaw (the front face of a double-faced card) to become a copy of Elite Vanguard (a 2/1 Human Soldier creature) until end of turn. The player then casts Moonmist, which reads, in part, �Transform all Humans.� Because the copy of Elite Vanguard is a double-faced card, it will transform. The resulting permanent will have its back face up, but it will still be a copy of Elite Vanguard that turn.

711.6. If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent, and the face that permanent would transform into is represented by an instant or sorcery card face, nothing happens.

711.7. If a double-faced card is cast as a spell, it�s put on the stack with its front face up. See rule 601, �Casting Spells.�

711.8. A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default. If a spell or ability puts it onto the battlefield �transformed,� it enters the battlefield with its back face up.

711.8a If a player is instructed to put a card that isn�t a double-faced card onto the battlefield transformed, that card stays in its current zone.

711.9. If an effect allows a player to cast a double-faced card as a face-down creature spell, or if a double-faced card enters the battlefield face down, it will have the characteristics given to it by the rule or effect that caused it to be face down. That card remains hidden, using either a face-down checklist card or opaque sleeves. See rule 707, �Face-Down Spells and Permanents.�

711.9a While face down, a double-faced permanent can�t transform. If it is turned face up, it will have its front face up.

711.10. Double-faced permanents can�t be turned face down. If a spell or ability tries to turn a double-faced permanent face down, nothing happens.

711.11. A double-faced card that is exiled face down remains hidden, using either a face-down checklist card or opaque sleeves. See rule 713, �Checklist Cards.�

711.12. When a double-faced permanent transforms, it doesn�t become a new object. Any effects that applied to that permanent will continue to apply to it after it transforms.
Example: An effect gives Village Ironsmith (the front face of a double-faced card) +2/+2 until end of turn and then Village Ironsmith transforms into Ironfang. Ironfang will continue to get +2/+2 until end of turn.

711.13. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player may name either face of a double-faced card but not both.

712. Meld Cards

712.1. A meld card has a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized Magic card face on the other. It doesn�t have a Magic card back.

712.1a There are three specific meld pairs. Each meld pair consists of two specific cards whose back faces combine to form one oversized Magic card face: Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats meld to form Chittering Host; Hanweir Garrison and Hanweir Battlements meld to form Hanweir, the Writhing Township; and Bruna, the Fading Light and Gisela, the Broken Blade meld to form Brisela, Voice of Nightmares.

712.1b A meld card isn�t a double-faced card. It can�t transform or enter the battlefield transformed. (See rule 711, �Double-Faced Cards.�)

712.2. One card in each meld pair has an ability that exiles both that object and its counterpart and melds them. To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and combined (see rule 701.35, �Meld�). The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.

712.3. The front face of each meld card and the combined face formed by a meld pair each has its own set of characteristics.

712.3a While a meld card is outside the game, in a zone other than the battlefield, or on the battlefield with its front face up, it has only the characteristics of its front face.

712.3b While the two cards of a meld pair are on the battlefield as a melded permanent, the object represented by those cards has only the characteristics of the combined back face, and its converted mana cost is the sum of the converted mana costs of its front faces. If a permanent is copying a melded permanent, the converted mana cost of the copy is 0. See rule 202.3c.

712.3c Anything that needs information about a meld card or a melded permanent sees only the information given by the face that is currently up.
Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Chittering Host (the combined back face of a meld pair). It has the characteristics of Chittering Host, even though the object it becomes is represented by only a single card, and its converted mana cost is 0.

712.4. If a melded permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and two cards are put into the appropriate zone.
Example: Chittering Host, a melded permanent, dies. An ability that triggers �whenever a creature dies� triggers once. An ability that triggers �whenever a card is put into a graveyard from anywhere� triggers twice.

712.4a If a melded permanent is put into its owner�s graveyard or library, that player may arrange the two cards in any order. If it�s put into its owner�s library, that player doesn�t reveal the order.

712.4b If a player exiles a melded permanent, that player determines the relative timestamp order of the two cards at that time. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 613.6j.
Example: Duplicant is a card with the abilities �When Duplicant enters the battlefield, you may exile target nontoken creature� and �As long as a card exiled with Duplicant is a creature card, Duplicant has the power, toughness, and creature types of the last creature card exiled with Duplicant. It�s still a Shapeshifter.� As Duplicant�s first ability exiles Chittering Host, a melded permanent, Duplicant�s controller chooses whether the last creature card exiled is Midnight Scavengers or Graf Rats.

712.4c If an effect can find the new object that a melded permanent becomes as it leaves the battlefield, it finds both cards. (See rule 400.7.) If that effect causes actions to be taken upon those cards, the same actions are taken upon each of them.
Example: Otherworldly Journey is an instant that reads �Exile target creature. At the beginning of the next end step, return that card to the battlefield under its owner�s control with a +1/+1 counter on it.� A player casts Otherworldly Journey targeting Chittering Host, a melded permanent. Chittering Host is exiled. At the beginning of the next end step, Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both returned to the battlefield, each with a +1/+1 counter on it.
Example: False Demise is an Aura with the ability �When enchanted creature dies, return that card to the battlefield under your control.� A Chittering Host enchanted by False Demise dies. The triggered ability returns both Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats to the battlefield.
Example: Mimic Vat is an artifact that reads, in part, �Whenever a nontoken creature dies, you may exile that card.� A Chittering Host dies. As Mimic Vat�s triggered ability resolves, its controller makes a single choice and both cards that represented Chittering Host are either exiled or not.

712.4d If multiple replacement effects could be applied to the event of a melded permanent leaving the battlefield or being put into the new zone, applying one of those replacement effects to one of the two cards affects both cards. If the melded permanent is a commander, it may be exempt from this rule; see rule 903.9a.
Example: Leyline of the Void is an enchantment that reads, in part, �If a card would be put into an opponent�s graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.� Wheel of Sun and Moon is an Aura with enchant player and the ability �If a card would be put into enchanted player�s graveyard from anywhere, instead that card is revealed and put on the bottom of its owner�s library.� If the controller of Chittering Host is affected by both cards� effects, that player chooses one effect to apply to the event and Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both moved to the appropriate zone.

712.4e If an effect needs to know the number of objects that changed zones, a melded permanent among those objects counts as one object that moved. If the effect needs to know the number of cards that changed zones, that melded permanent counts as two cards that moved.

712.5. Players who are allowed to look at a meld card may look at its half of the combined back face. Players may access Oracle text for the other member of the meld pair and the combined face at any time (see rule 108.1).

712.6. Meld cards in a player�s deck may be represented by checklist cards. See rule 713, �Checklist Cards.�

712.7. If a meld card is cast as a spell, it�s put on the stack with its front face up. See rule 601, �Casting Spells.�

712.8. A meld card enters the battlefield with its front face up unless it�s being melded with its counterpart.

712.9. If an effect allows a player to cast a meld card as a face-down spell, or if a meld card enters the battlefield face down, it will have the characteristics given to it by the rule or effect that caused it to be face down. That card remains hidden, using either a face-down checklist card or opaque sleeves. See rule 707, �Face-Down Spells and Permanents.�

712.10. Meld cards on the battlefield and melded permanents can�t be turned face down. If a spell or ability tries to turn such a permanent face down, nothing happens.

712.11. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player may choose the name of a front face of a meld card or the combined back face of a meld pair.

713. Checklist Cards

713.1. A checklist card is a game supplement that can be used to represent a double-faced card or meld card.

713.2. A checklist card has a normal Magic card back. The face of a checklist card is divided into sections. Each section lists the name and mana cost of each double-faced card or meld card it could represent and includes a fill-in circle. Before a checklist card can be used, exactly one of the fill-in circles must be marked to denote which card the checklist card represents.

713.3. If a checklist card is used in a deck, the card it represents is set aside prior to the beginning of the game (see rule 103.1a) and must remain available throughout the game. A checklist card can�t be included in a deck unless it is representing a double-faced card or a meld card.

713.4. For all game purposes, the checklist card is considered to be the card it�s representing.

713.5. If the checklist card is face up in a public zone, it should be set aside and the double-faced card or meld card that it represents should be used instead.

714. Controlling Another Player

714.1. Some cards allow a player to control another player during that player�s next turn. This effect applies to the next turn that the affected player actually takes. The affected player is controlled during the entire turn; the effect doesn�t end until the beginning of the next turn.

714.1a Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.

714.1b If a turn is skipped, any pending player-controlling effects wait until the player who would be affected actually takes a turn.

714.2. One card (Word of Command) allows a player to control another player for a limited duration.

714.3. Only control of the player changes. All objects are controlled by their normal controllers. A player who�s being controlled during his or her turn is still the active player.

714.4. If information about an object in the game would be visible to the player being controlled, it�s visible to both that player and the controller of the player. If information about cards outside the game would be visible to the player being controlled, it�s visible only to that player, not the controller of the player.
Example: The controller of a player can see that player�s hand and the face of any face-down creatures he or she controls.

714.5. While controlling another player, a player makes all choices and decisions the controlled player is allowed to make or is told to make by the rules or by any objects. This includes choices and decisions about what to play, and choices and decisions called for by spells and abilities.
Example: The controller of another player decides which spells that player casts and what those spells target, and makes any required decisions when those spells resolve.
Example: The controller of another player during his or her turn decides which of that player�s creatures attack, which player or planeswalker each one attacks, what the damage assignment order of the creatures that block them is (if any of the attacking creatures are blocked by multiple creatures), and how those attacking creatures assign their combat damage.

714.5a The controller of another player can use only that player�s resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player.
Example: If the controller of a player decides that the controlled player will cast a spell with an additional cost of discarding cards, the cards are discarded from the controlled player�s hand.

714.5b The controller of another player can�t make choices or decisions for that player that aren�t called for by the rules or by any objects. The controller also can�t make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules.
Example: The player who�s being controlled still chooses whether he or she leaves to visit the restroom, trades a card to someone else, agrees to an intentional draw, or calls a judge about an error or infraction.

714.6. The controller of another player can�t make that player concede. A player may concede the game at any time, even if he or she is controlled by another player. See rule 104.3a.

714.7. The effect that gives control of a player to another player may restrict the actions the controlled player is allowed to take or specify actions that the controlled player must take.

714.8. A player who controls another player also continues to make his or her own choices and decisions.

714.9. A player may gain control of himself or herself. That player will make his or her own decisions and choices as normal.

715. Ending the Turn

715.1. Some cards end the turn. When an effect ends the turn, follow these steps in order, as they differ from the normal process for resolving spells and abilities (see rule 608, �Resolving Spells and Abilities�).

715.1a If there are any triggered abilities that triggered before this process began but haven�t been put onto the stack yet, those abilities cease to exist. They won�t be put onto the stack. This rule does not apply to abilities that trigger during this process (see rule 715.2).

715.1b Exile every object on the stack, including the object that�s resolving. Remove all creatures and planeswalkers from combat. All objects not on the battlefield or in the command zone that aren�t represented by cards will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are checked (see rule 704, �State-Based Actions�).

715.1c Check state-based actions. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack.

715.1d The current phase and/or step ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step; skip any phases or steps between this phase or step and the cleanup step. If an effect ends the turn during the cleanup step, a new cleanup step begins.

715.2. No player gets priority during this process, so triggered abilities are not put onto the stack. If any triggered abilities have triggered since this process began, those abilities are put onto the stack during the cleanup step, then the active player gets priority and players can cast spells and activate abilities. Then there will be another cleanup step before the turn finally ends. If no triggered abilities have triggered during this process, no player gets priority during the cleanup step. See rule 514, �Cleanup Step.�

715.3. Even though the turn ends, �at the beginning of the end step� triggered abilities don�t trigger because the end step is skipped.

716. The Monarch

716.1. The monarch is a designation a player can have. There is no monarch in a game until an effect instructs a player to become the monarch.

716.2. There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. This is an exception to rule 112.8. The full texts of these abilities are �At the beginning of the monarch�s end step, that player draws a card� and �Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch.�

716.3. Only one player can be the monarch at a time. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch ceases to be the monarch.

716.4. If the monarch leaves the game, the active player becomes the monarch at the same time as that player leaves the game. If the active player is leaving the game or if there is no active player, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch.

717. Restarting the Game

717.1. One card (Karn Liberated) restarts the game. A game that is restarted immediately ends. No players in that game win, lose, or draw that game. All players in that game when it ended then start a new game following the procedures set forth in rule 103, �Starting the Game,� with the following exception:

717.1a The starting player in the new game is the player who controlled the spell or ability that restarted the game.

717.2. All Magic cards involved in the game that was restarted when it ended, including phased-out permanents and nontraditional Magic cards, are involved in the new game, even if those cards were not originally involved in the restarted game. Ownership of cards in the new game doesn�t change, regardless of their location when the new game begins.
Example: A player casts Living Wish, bringing a creature card into the game from outside the game. Then that game is restarted. The creature card will be part of that player�s library when the new game begins.

717.3. Because each player draws seven cards when the new game begins, any player with fewer than seven cards in his or her library will lose the game when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep step of the first turn, regardless of any mulligans that player takes. (See rule 704, �State-Based Actions.�)

717.4. The effect that restarts the game finishes resolving just before the first turn�s untap step. If the spell or ability that generated that effect has additional instructions, those instructions are followed at this time. No player has priority, and any triggered abilities that trigger as a result will go on the stack the next time a player receives priority, usually during the first turn�s upkeep step.

717.5. Effects may exempt certain cards from the procedure that restarts the game. These cards are not in their owner�s deck as the new game begins.

717.5a In a Commander game, a commander that has been exempted from the procedure that restarts the game won�t begin the new game in the command zone. However, it remains that deck�s commander for the new game. See rule 903, �Commander.�

717.6. If a Magic subgame (see rule 718) is restarted, the main game is unaffected. Main-game effects that refer to the winner or loser of the subgame now refer to the winner or loser of the restarted subgame.

717.7. If a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule 801) is restarted, all players in the game are involved, regardless of the range of influence of the player who controls the ability that restarted the game.

718. Subgames

718.1. One card (Shahrazad) allows players to play a Magic subgame.

718.1a A �subgame� is a completely separate Magic game created by an effect. Essentially, it�s a game within a game. The �main game� is the game in which the spell or ability that created the subgame was cast or activated. The main game is temporarily discontinued while the subgame is in progress. It resumes when the subgame ends.

718.1b No effects or definitions created in either the main game or the subgame have any meaning in the other, except as defined by the effect that created the subgame. For example, the effect may say that something happens in the main game to the winner or loser of the subgame.

718.2. As the subgame starts, an entirely new set of game zones is created. Each player takes all the cards in his or her main-game library, moves them to his or her subgame library, and shuffles them. No other cards in a main-game zone are moved to their corresponding subgame zone, except as specified in rules 718.2a�d. Randomly determine which player goes first. The subgame proceeds like a normal game, following all other rules in rule 103, �Starting the Game.�

718.2a As a subgame of a Planechase game starts, each player moves his or her planar deck from the main-game command zone to the subgame command zone and shuffles it. (Face-up plane and phenomenon cards remain in the main-game command zone.)

718.2b As a subgame of a Vanguard game starts, each player moves his or her vanguard card from the main-game command zone to the subgame command zone.

718.2c As a subgame of a Commander game starts, each player moves his or her commander from the main-game command zone (if it�s there) to the subgame command zone.

718.2d As a subgame of an Archenemy game starts, the archenemy moves his or her scheme deck from the main-game command zone to the subgame command zone and shuffles it. (Face-up scheme cards remain in the main-game command zone.)

718.3. Because each player draws seven cards when a game begins, any player with fewer than seven cards in his or her deck will lose the subgame when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep step of the first turn, regardless of any mulligans that player takes. (See rule 704, �State-Based Actions.�)

718.4. All objects in the main game and all cards outside the main game are considered outside the subgame (except those specifically brought into the subgame). All players not currently in the subgame are considered outside the subgame.

718.4a Some effects can bring cards into a game from outside of it. If a card is brought into a subgame from a main game, abilities in the main game that trigger on objects leaving a main-game zone will trigger, but they won�t be put onto the stack until the main game resumes.

718.4b A player�s main-game counters aren�t considered part of the subgame, although the player will still have them when the main game resumes. Similarly, any counters a player gets during a subgame will cease to exist when the subgame ends.

718.5. At the end of a subgame, each player takes all cards he or she owns that are in the subgame other than those in the subgame command zone, puts them into his or her main-game library, then shuffles them. This includes cards in the subgame�s exile zone. Except as specified in rules 718.5a�c, all other objects in the subgame cease to exist, as do the zones created for the subgame. The main game continues from the point at which it was discontinued: First, the spell or ability that created the subgame finishes resolving, even if it was created by a spell card that�s no longer on the stack. Then, if any main-game abilities triggered while the subgame was in progress due to cards being removed from the main game, those abilities are put onto the stack.
Example: If a card was brought into the subgame either from the main game or from outside the main game, that card will be put into its owner�s main-game library when the subgame ends.

718.5a At the end of a subgame of a Planechase game, each face-up plane card or phenomenon card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner�s planar deck. Then each player moves his or her planar deck from the subgame command zone to the main-game command zone and shuffles it.

718.5b At the end of a subgame of a Vanguard game, each player moves his or her vanguard card from the subgame command zone to the main-game command zone. This is an exception to rule 311.2.

718.5c At the end of a subgame of a Commander game, each player moves his or her commander from the subgame command zone (if it�s there) to the main-game command zone.

718.5d At the end of a subgame of an Archenemy game, any face-up scheme cards in the subgame command zone are turned face down and put on the bottom of their owner�s scheme deck. Then the archenemy moves his or her scheme deck from the subgame command zone to the main-game command zone and shuffles it.

718.6. A subgame can be created within a subgame. The existing subgame becomes the main game in relation to the new subgame.

719. Taking Shortcuts

719.1. When playing a game, players typically make use of mutually understood shortcuts rather than explicitly identifying each game choice (either taking an action or passing priority) a player makes.

719.1a The rules for taking shortcuts are largely informal. As long as each player in the game understands the intent of each other player, any shortcut system they use is acceptable.

719.1b Occasionally the game gets into a state in which a set of actions could be repeated indefinitely (thus creating a �loop�). In that case, the shortcut rules can be used to determine how many times those actions are repeated without having to actually perform them, and how the loop is broken.

719.2. Taking a shortcut follows the following procedure.

719.2a At any point in the game, the player with priority may suggest a shortcut by describing a sequence of game choices, for all players, that may be legally taken based on the current game state and the predictable results of the sequence of choices. This sequence may be a non-repetitive series of choices, a loop that repeats a specified number of times, multiple loops, or nested loops, and may even cross multiple turns. It can�t include conditional actions, where the outcome of a game event determines the next action a player takes. The ending point of this sequence must be a place where a player has priority, though it need not be the player proposing the shortcut.
Example: A player controls a creature enchanted by Presence of Gond, which grants the creature the ability �{T}: Create a 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature token,� and another player controls Intruder Alarm, which reads, in part, �Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, untap all creatures.� When the player has priority, he or she may suggest �I�ll create a million tokens,� indicating the sequence of activating the creature�s ability, all players passing priority, letting the creature�s ability resolve and create a token (which causes Intruder Alarm�s ability to trigger), Intruder Alarm�s controller putting that triggered ability on the stack, all players passing priority, Intruder Alarm�s triggered ability resolving, all players passing priority until the player proposing the shortcut has priority, and repeating that sequence 999,999 more times, ending just after the last token-creating ability resolves.

719.2b Each other player, in turn order starting after the player who suggested the shortcut, may either accept the proposed sequence, or shorten it by naming a place where he or she will make a game choice that�s different than what�s been proposed. (The player doesn�t need to specify at this time what the new choice will be.) This place becomes the new ending point of the proposed sequence.
Example: The active player draws a card during her draw step, then says, �Go.� The nonactive player is holding Into the Fray (an instant that says �Target creature attacks this turn if able�) and says, �I�d like to cast a spell during your beginning of combat step.� The current proposed shortcut is that all players pass priority at all opportunities during the turn until the nonactive player has priority during the beginning of combat step.

719.2c Once the last player has either accepted or shortened the shortcut proposal, the shortcut is taken. The game advances to the last proposed ending point, with all game choices contained in the shortcut proposal having been taken. If the shortcut was shortened from the original proposal, the player who now has priority must make a different game choice than what was originally proposed for that player.

719.3. Sometimes a loop can be fragmented, meaning that each player involved in the loop performs an independent action that results in the same game state being reached multiple times. If that happens, the active player (or, if the active player is not involved in the loop, the first player in turn order who is involved) must then make a different game choice so the loop does not continue.
Example: In a two-player game, the active player controls a creature with the ability �{0}: [This creature] gains flying,� the nonactive player controls a permanent with the ability �{0}: Target creature loses flying,� and nothing in the game cares how many times an ability has been activated. Say the active player activates his creature�s ability, it resolves, then the nonactive player activates her permanent�s ability targeting that creature, and it resolves. This returns the game to a game state it was at before. The active player must make a different game choice (in other words, anything other than activating that creature�s ability again). The creature doesn�t have flying. Note that the nonactive player could have prevented the fragmented loop simply by not activating her permanent�s ability, in which case the creature would have had flying. The nonactive player always has the final choice and is therefore able to determine whether the creature has flying.

719.4. If a loop contains only mandatory actions, the game is a draw. (See rules 104.4b and 104.4f.)

719.5. No player can be forced to perform an action that would end a loop other than actions called for by objects involved in the loop.
Example: A player controls Seal of Cleansing, an enchantment that reads, �Sacrifice Seal of Cleansing: Destroy target artifact or enchantment.� A mandatory loop that involves an artifact begins. The player is not forced to sacrifice Seal of Cleansing to destroy the artifact and end the loop.

719.6. If a loop contains an effect that says �[A] unless [B],� where [A] and [B] are each actions, no player can be forced to perform [B] to break the loop. If no player chooses to perform [B], the loop will continue as though [A] were mandatory.

720. Handling Illegal Actions

720.1. If a player takes an illegal action or starts to take an action but can�t legally complete it, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was casting a spell, the spell returns to the zone it came from. The player may also reverse any legal mana abilities activated while making the illegal play, unless mana from them or from any triggered mana abilities they triggered was spent on another mana ability that wasn�t reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a library, moved cards from a library to any zone other than the stack, caused a library to be shuffled, or caused cards from a library to be revealed.

720.2. When reversing illegal spells and abilities, the player who had priority retains it and may take another action or pass. The player may redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action allowed by the rules.

8. Multiplayer Rules

800. General

800.1. A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for multiplayer play.

800.2. These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.

800.3. Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck construction. See the most current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information. They can be found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.

800.4. Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.

800.4a When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule 109) owned by that player leave the game and any effects which give that player control of any objects or players end. Then, if that player controlled any objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist. Then, if there are any objects still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left, priority passes to the next player in turn order who�s still in the game.
Example: Alex casts Mind Control, an Aura that reads, �You control enchanted creature,� on Bianca�s Assault Griffin. If Alex leaves the game, so does Mind Control, and Assault Griffin reverts to Bianca�s control. If, instead, Bianca leaves the game, so does Assault Griffin, and Mind Control is put into Alex�s graveyard.
Example: Alex casts Act of Treason, which reads, in part, �Gain control of target creature until end of turn,� targeting Bianca�s Runeclaw Bears. If Alex leaves the game, Act of Treason�s change-of-control effect ends and Runeclaw Bears reverts to Bianca�s control.
Example: Alex casts Bribery, which reads, �Search target opponent�s library for a creature card and put that card onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles their library,� targeting Bianca. Alex puts Serra Angel onto the battlefield from Bianca�s library. If Bianca leaves the game, Serra Angel also leaves the game. If, instead, Alex leaves the game, Serra Angel is exiled.
Example: Alex controls Genesis Chamber, which reads, �Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield, if Genesis Chamber is untapped, that creature�s controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.� If Alex leaves the game, all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under Alex�s control leave the game, and all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under any other player�s control remain in the game.

800.4b If an object would change to the control of a player who has left the game, it doesn�t. If a token would be created under the control of a player who has left the game, no token is created. If an object would be put onto the battlefield or onto the stack under the control of a player who has left the game, that object remains in its current zone. If a player would be controlled by a player who has left the game, they aren�t.

800.4c If an effect that gives a player still in the game control of an object ends, there is no other effect giving control of that object to another player in the game, and the object entered the battlefield under the control of a player who has left the game, the object is exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the control-changing effect ends.

800.4d If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game would be created in any zone, it isn�t created. If a triggered ability that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put onto the stack, it isn�t put on the stack.
Example: Astral Slide is an enchantment that reads, �Whenever a player cycles a card, you may exile target creature. If you do, return that creature to the battlefield under its owner�s control at the beginning of the next end step.� During Alex�s turn, Bianca uses Astral Slide�s ability to exile Alex�s Hypnotic Specter. Before the end of that turn, Bianca leaves the game. At the beginning of the end step, the delayed triggered ability generated by Astral Slide that would return Hypnotic Specter to the battlefield triggers, but it isn�t put on the stack. Hypnotic Specter never returns to the battlefield.

800.4e If combat damage would be assigned to a player who has left the game, that damage isn�t assigned.

800.4f If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the controller of the object chooses another player to make that choice. If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if possible.

800.4g If a rule requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the next player in turn order makes that choice.

800.4h If an effect requires information about a specific player, the effect uses the current information about that player if they are still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information about that player before they left the game.

800.4i If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues to its completion without an active player. If the active player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order receives priority, or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or step ends, whichever is appropriate.

800.4j If a player who has left the game would begin a turn, that turn doesn�t begin.

800.4k When a player leaves the game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player�s next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.

800.4m When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante zone do not leave the game. This is an exception to rule 800.4a. See rule 407, �Ante.�

800.4n In a Planechase game, if the player designated as the planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn�t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. See rule 309.5.

800.5. In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, they draw a new hand of as many cards as they had before. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.

800.6. In a multiplayer game other than a Two-Headed Giant game, the starting player doesn�t skip the draw step of their first turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. See rule 103.7.

801. Limited Range of Influence Option

801.1. Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. It�s always used in the Emperor variant (see rule 809), and it�s often used for games involving five or more players.

801.2. A player�s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that player�s range of influence. Objects controlled by players within a player�s range of influence are also within that player�s range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, making choices, and winning the game.

801.2a The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat and 2 seats. Different players may have different ranges of influence.
Example: A range of influence of 1 means that only you and the players seated directly next to you are within your range of influence.
Example: A range of influence of 2 means that you and the two players to your left and the two players to your right are within your range of influence.

801.2b A player is always within their own range of influence.

801.2c The particular players within each player�s range of influence are determined as each turn begins.
Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa is seated to the right of Rob. Carissa is not in Alex�s range of influence. If Rob leaves the game, Carissa will enter Alex�s range of influence at the start of the next turn.

801.2d An object is within a player�s range of influence if it�s controlled by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player.

801.3. Creatures can attack only opponents within their controller�s range of influence or planeswalkers controlled by those opponents. If no opponents are within a player�s range of influence, creatures that player controls can�t attack.

801.4. Objects and players outside a player�s range of influence can�t be the targets of spells or abilities that player controls.

801.5. Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of influence option is used.

801.5a If a player is asked to choose an object or player, he or she must choose one within his or her range of influence.
Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Alex activates the ability of Cuombajj Witches, which reads, �Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to target creature or player and 1 damage to target creature or player of an opponent�s choice,� targeting Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other target. Rob must choose a target that�s in both his range of influence and in the range of influence of the controller of Cuombajj Witches. He must therefore choose himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either himself or Alex.

801.5b If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or players), they can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the player�s range of influence.
Example: Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa, who has a range of influence of 1, is seated to the right of Rob. Alex casts a spell that reads, �An opponent chooses one � You draw two cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn,� and chooses Carissa to make that choice. Carissa can choose the mode even though Alex is out of her range.

801.5c If an effect requires a choice and there�s no player who can make that choice within its controller�s range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controller�s left makes that choice.
Example: In an Emperor game in which all players have range of influence 1, an emperor casts Fact or Fiction, which reads, �Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.� Since no opponent is within the emperor�s range of influence, the nearest opponent to the emperor�s left separates the cards into piles.

801.6. A player can�t activate the activated abilities of an object outside of their range of influence.

801.7. A triggered ability doesn�t trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of influence of its source�s controller.
Example: In a game in which all players have range of influence 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Rob controls two Auras attached to Alex�s Runeclaw Bear: One with the trigger condition �Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked,� and one with the trigger condition �Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked by a creature.� Alex�s Runeclaw Bear attacks the player to Alex�s left and becomes blocked. The ability of Rob�s first Aura triggers because the entire event (Runeclaw Bear becomes blocked) happens within Rob�s range of influence. The ability of Rob�s second Aura doesn�t trigger, however, because that event includes the blocking creature, which is out of Rob�s range.

801.7a If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a player�s range of influence, use the game state before or after the event as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger. See rules 603.6 and 603.10.
Example: Carissa and Alex are outside each other�s range of influence. Carissa controls a Runeclaw Bear owned by Alex and they each control an Extractor Demon, a creature which reads, in part, �Whenever another creature leaves the battlefield, you may have target player put the top two cards of their library into their graveyard.� The Runeclaw Bear is destroyed and is put into Alex�s graveyard. The ability of Alex�s Extractor Demon doesn�t trigger because the leaves-the-battlefield event was outside Alex�s range of influence. The ability of Carissa�s Extractor Demon does trigger, even though the creature is going to a graveyard outside her range, because the leaves-the-battlefield event was within her range.

801.8. An Aura can�t enchant an object or player outside its controller�s range of influence. If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, the Aura is put into its owner�s graveyard as a state-based action. See rule 704.

801.9. An Equipment can�t equip an object outside its controller�s range of influence, and a Fortification can�t fortify an object outside its controller�s range of influence. If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.

801.10. Spells and abilities can�t affect objects or players outside their controller�s range of influence. The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of the effect will work normally.
Example: In a six-player game in which each player has range of influence 1, Alex casts Pyroclasm, which reads, �Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.� Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature controlled by Alex, the player to Alex�s left, and the player to Alex�s right. No other creatures are dealt damage.

801.11. If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its controller�s range of influence. It doesn�t see objects or events outside its controller�s range of influence.
Example: In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1, Alex controls Coat of Arms, which reads, �Each creature gets +1/+1 for each other creature on the battlefield that shares at least one creature type with it.� Coat of Arms will boost Alex�s creatures based only on what creatures are controlled by Alex, the player to Alex�s left, and the player to Alex�s right. It won�t take other creatures into account.
Example: In the same game, Rob is sitting to the right of Alex. Coat of Arms will boost Rob�s creatures based on what creatures are controlled by players within Alex�s range of influence, including the player sitting to Alex�s left, who�s out of Rob�s range of influence.

801.12. The �world rule� (see rule 704.5k) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within its controller�s range of influence.

801.13. Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain instructions that can�t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions. See rule 614, �Replacement Effects,� and rule 615, �Prevention Effects.�

801.13a If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to affect an object or player outside its controller�s range of influence, that portion of the event does nothing.
Example: Alex casts Lava Axe (�Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player�) targeting Rob. In response, Rob casts Captain�s Maneuver (�The next X damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn is dealt to another target creature or player instead�) with X equal to 3, targeting Carissa. Carissa isn�t in Alex�s range of influence. When Lava Axe resolves, it deals 2 damage to Rob and no damage to Carissa.

801.13b If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt by a source, it can affect only sources within the spell or ability�s controller�s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a permanent or player, it can affect only permanents and players within the spell or ability�s controller�s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be recipient of the damage is specified, it prevents damage only if both the source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or ability�s controller�s range of influence.
Example: Rob is within Alex�s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Alex controls an enchantment that says, �Prevent all damage that would be dealt by creatures.� Carissa attacks Rob with a creature. The creature deals combat damage to Rob.
Example: Rob is within Alex�s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa casts Lightning Blast (�Lightning Blast deals 4 damage to target creature or player�) targeting Rob. In response, Alex casts Mending Hands (�Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn�) targeting Rob. The damage to Rob is prevented.
Example: Rob is within Alex�s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa attacks Rob with a creature, and Rob blocks with a creature. Alex casts Fog (�Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.�) Carissa and Rob�s creatures deal combat damage to each other.

801.14. If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that player�s opponents within that player�s range of influence lose the game instead.

801.15. If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw, the game is a draw for that spell or ability�s controller and all players within that player�s range of influence. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.

801.16. If the game somehow enters a �loop� of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object that�s involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.

801.17. Effects that restart the game (see rule 717) are exempt from the limited range of influence option. All players in the game will be involved in the new game.

801.18. In multiplayer Planechase games other than Grand Melee games, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. See rule 901, �Planechase.�

802. Attack Multiple Players Option

802.1. Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. If this option is used, a player can also choose to attack only one player during a particular combat.

802.2. As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesn�t choose an opponent to become the defending player. Instead, all the attacking player�s opponents are defending players during the combat phase.

802.2a Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a �defending player� refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it�s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it�s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.
Example: Rob attacks Alex with Runeclaw Bear and attacks Carissa with a creature with mountainwalk. Whether the creature with mountainwalk can be blocked depends only on whether Carissa controls a Mountain.

802.3. As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, they choose a defending player or a planeswalker controlled by a defending player for it to attack. See rule 508, �Declare Attackers Step.�

802.3a Restrictions and requirements that don�t apply to attacking a specific player are evaluated based on the entire group of attacking creatures. Restrictions and requirements that apply to attacking a specific player apply only to creatures attacking that player. The entire group of attacking creatures must still be legal. See rule 508.1.

802.3b Creatures in a band can�t attack different players. See rule 702.21, �Banding.�

802.4. If more than one player is being attacked or controls a planeswalker that�s being attacked, each defending player in APNAP order declares blockers as the declare blockers step begins. (See rule 101.4 and rule 509, �Declare Blockers Step.�) The first defending player declares all their blocks, then the second defending player, and so on.

802.4a A defending player can block only with creatures they control. Those creatures can block only creatures attacking that player or a planeswalker that player controls.

802.4b When determining whether a defending player�s blocks are legal, ignore any creatures attacking other players and any blocking creatures controlled by other players.

802.5. After blockers have been declared, if any creatures are blocking multiple creatures, each defending player in APNAP order announces the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures for each blocking creature they control. See rule 510, �Combat Damage Step.�

802.6. Combat damage is assigned in APNAP order. Other than that, the combat damage step proceeds just as in a two-player game. See rule 510, �Combat Damage Step.�

803. Attack Left and Attack Right Options

803.1. Some multiplayer games use the optional attack left or attack right rules.

803.1a If the attack left option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their left. If a player�s nearest opponent to the left is more than one seat away, the player can�t attack.

803.1b If the attack right option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their right. If a player�s nearest opponent to the right is more than one seat away, the player can�t attack.

804. Deploy Creatures Option

804.1. The Emperor variant always uses the deploy creatures option, and it can be used in other variants that allow players to compete in teams. Multiplayer formats in which players compete as individuals usually don�t use this option.

804.2. Each creature has the ability �{T}: Target teammate gains control of this creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.�

805. Shared Team Turns Option

805.1. Some multiplayer games between teams use the shared team turns option. It�s always used in the Two-Headed Giant variant (see rule 810) and the Archenemy casual variant (see rule 904). It can be used only if the members of each team are sitting in adjacent seats.

805.2. Within each team, the player seated in the rightmost seat from that team�s perspective is the primary player. If the players on a team can�t agree on a choice, such as which creatures attack or what order triggered abilities are put on the stack, the primary player makes that choice.

805.3. The methods described in rule 103.2 are used to determine which team will take the first turn. The team determined this way is the starting team.

805.3a The process for handling mulligans is altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, declares whether that player will take a mulligan. Then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand. After all players have kept an opening hand, any player on the starting team whose hand contains fewer cards than that player�s starting hand size may look at the top card of their library. That player�s teammates may also look at that card. The player may put that card on the bottom of their library. This process is repeated for each other team in turn order. See rule 103.4.

805.3b The process for handling cards that allow a player to begin the game with them on the battlefield is altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, may put any or all such cards onto the battlefield from that player�s opening hand. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then each player on each other team in turn order does the same.

805.4. Each team takes turns rather than each player.

805.4a The team whose turn it is is the active team. Each other team is a nonactive team.

805.4b Each player on a team draws a card during that team�s draw step.

805.4c Each player on a team may play a land during each of that team�s turns.

805.5. Teams have priority, not individual players.

805.5a A player may cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action when their team has priority.

805.5b If a team has priority and no player on that team wishes to do anything, that team passes. If all teams pass in succession (that is, if all teams pass without any player taking any actions in between passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active team receives priority. If the stack is empty when all teams pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.

805.6. The Active Player, Nonactive Player order rule (see rule 101.4) is modified if the shared team turns option is used. If multiple teams would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first the active team makes any choices required, then each nonactive team in turn order makes any choices required. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first each player on the active team makes any choices required in whatever order they like, then the players on each nonactive team in turn order do the same. Once all choices have been made, the actions happen simultaneously.

805.6a If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a game that�s using the shared team turns option, first each player on the active team, in whatever order that team likes, performs that player�s draws, then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.

805.7. If multiple triggered abilities have triggered since the last time a team received priority, the members of the active team put all triggered abilities any of them controls on the stack in any order they choose, then the members of each nonactive team in turn order do the same.

805.8. If an effect gives a player an extra turn or adds a phase or step to that player�s turn, that player�s team takes the extra turn, phase, or step. If an effect causes a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, that player�s team does so. If a single effect causes more than one player on the same team to add or skip the same step, phase, or turn, that team adds or skips only that step, phase, or turn. If an effect causes a player to control another player, the first player controls the affected player�s team.

805.9. Any ability that refers to the �active player� refers to one specific active player, not to all of the active players. The ability�s controller chooses which one the ability refers to at the time its effect is applied.

805.10. The shared team turns option uses different combat rules than other multiplayer options.

805.10a Each team�s creatures attack the other team as a group. During the combat phase, the active team is the attacking team and each player on the active team is an attacking player. Likewise, the nonactive team is the defending team and each player on the nonactive team is a defending player.

805.10b As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares attackers. For each attacking creature, the attacking team announces which defending player or planeswalker that creature is attacking. The active team has one combined attack, and that set of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 508.1.

805.10c Any rule, object, or effect that refers to an �attacking player� refers to one specific attacking player, not to all of the attacking players. If an ability of a blocking creature refers to an attacking player, or a spell or ability refers to both a blocking creature and an attacking player, then unless otherwise specified, the attacking player it�s referring to is the player who controls that attacking creature. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple blocking creatures, the appropriate attacking player is individually determined for each of those blocking creatures. If there are multiple attacking players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.

805.10d As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares blockers. Creatures controlled by the defending players can block creatures attacking any player on the defending team or attacking a planeswalker controlled by one of those players. The defending team has one combined block, and that set of blocking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 509.1.

805.10e Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a �defending player� refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it�s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it�s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.

805.10f Once blockers have been declared, for each attacking creature that�s become blocked by multiple creatures, the active team announces the damage assignment order among the blocking creatures. Then, for each creature that�s blocking multiple creatures, the defending team announces the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures.

805.10g As the combat damage step begins, the active team announces how each attacking creature will assign its combat damage. Then the defending team announces how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage. See rule 510.1.

806. Free-for-All Variant

806.1. In Free-for-All multiplayer games, a group of players compete as individuals against each other.

806.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Free-for-All variant uses the following default options.

806.2a The limited range of influence option usually isn�t used in Free-for-All games. If it is, each player has the same range of influence, which is determined before play begins. See rule 801, �Limited Range of Influence Option.�

806.2b Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See rule 803, �Attack Left and Attack Right Options,� and rule 802, �Attack Multiple Players Option.�

806.2c The deploy creatures option isn�t used in the Free-for-All variant.

806.3. The players are randomly seated around the table.

807. Grand Melee Variant

807.1. The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant, in which a group of players compete against each other as individuals. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more players.

807.2. Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins. The Grand Melee variant uses the following default options.

807.2a Each player has a range of influence of 1 (see rule 801).

807.2b The attack left option is used (see rule 803).

807.2c The attack multiple players and deploy creatures options aren�t used in the Grand Melee variant.

807.3. The players are seated at random.

807.4. The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving turn markers keep track of which players are currently taking turns. Each turn marker represents an active player�s turn.

807.4a There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.
Example: A Grand Melee game with sixteen players has four turn markers. A game with fifteen players has three turn markers.

807.4b The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker. The player four seats to that player�s left (the fifth player) takes the second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed out. Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way. Then all players with turn markers start their turns at the same time.

807.4c After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to their left takes the turn marker immediately.

807.4d A player who receives a turn marker can�t begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker.

807.4e If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed player�s right is designated for removal. If more than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times.

807.4f For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game (see rule 807.4e), disregard turn markers already designated for removal.

807.4g If a player who�s taking a turn has a turn marker that�s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player who�s not taking a turn has a turn marker that�s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal that many times minus one.

807.4h If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of those seats don�t enter one another�s range of influence until the next turn begins.

807.4i If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player�s left, the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player�s right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn.

807.4j If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player wouldn�t have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn instead.
Example: During Alex�s turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to take an extra turn after this one. During the same turn, the player to Alex�s left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be reduced. After Alex�s current turn ends, his turn marker is removed. He won�t take the extra turn from Time Walk until just before his normal turn the next time he receives a turn marker.

807.5. Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker represents its own stack.

807.5a A player gets priority for a particular turn marker�s stack only if the turn marker is within their range of influence or an object on that stack is controlled by a player within their range of influence.

807.5b If a player has priority for multiple stacks and casts a spell, activates an ability, or a triggered ability they control triggers, the player must specify which one of those stacks the spell or ability is put on. If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability to trigger, the player must put it on that stack. If a resolving spell or ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack. If a spell or ability targets an object on one of those stacks, it must be put on the same stack as its target; it can�t target objects on multiple stacks.

808. Team vs. Team Variant

808.1. Team vs. Team games are played with two or more teams. Each team may have any number of players on it.

808.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which its players sit.

808.3. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Team vs. Team variant uses the following default options.

808.3a The attack multiple players option is used (see rule 802).

808.3b The deploy creatures options and limited range of influence options usually aren�t used in the Team vs. Team variant.

808.4. To determine which player goes first, randomly choose a team. If that team has an odd number of players, the player in its center seat goes first. If that team has an even number of players, the player to the left of its midpoint goes first. Turn order goes to the players� left.

808.5. In the Team vs. Team variant, a team�s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each other�s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can�t manipulate each other�s cards or permanents.

809. Emperor Variant

809.1. The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players each.

809.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which it�s seated. Each team has one emperor, who sits in the middle of the team. The remaining players on the team are generals whose job is to protect the emperor.

809.3. The Emperor variant uses the following default options.

809.3a The range of influence is limited to 2 for emperors and 1 for generals. See rule 801, �Limited Range of Influence Option.�

809.3b Emperor games use the deploy creatures option (see rule 804).

809.3c A player can attack only an opponent seated immediately next to them.
Example: At the start of an Emperor game, neither emperor can attack any opponents, even though both of the opposing generals are within their spell range.

809.4. Randomly determine which emperor goes first. Turn order goes to the players� left.

809.5. The Emperor variant includes the following specifications for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)

809.5a A team wins the game if its emperor wins.

809.5b A team loses the game if its emperor loses.

809.5c The game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its emperor.

809.6. The Emperor variant can also be played with any number of equally sized teams. If the teams have more than three players, the range of influence of each player should be adjusted.

809.6a Each general�s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows one general from an opposing team to begin the game within their range of influence. Each emperor�s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows two generals from opposing teams to begin the game within their range of influence. Players should be seated such that no emperor begins the game within the range of influence of another emperor.
Example: In an Emperor game between two teams of four players each, the player configuration (either clockwise or counterclockwise around the table) should be: Team A general 1, Team A emperor, Team A general 2, Team A general 3, Team B general 1, Team B emperor, Team B general 2, Team B general 3. Each emperor has range of influence 3. Each general 2 has range of influence 2. Each general 1 and general 3 has range of influence 1.

809.7. In the Emperor variant, a team�s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each other�s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can�t manipulate each other�s cards or permanents.

810. Two-Headed Giant Variant

810.1. Two-Headed Giant games are played with two teams of two players each.

810.2. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the shared team turns option. (See rule 805.)

810.3. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which its players sit.

810.4. Each team has a shared life total, which starts at 30 life.

810.5. With the exception of life total and poison counters, a team�s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared in the Two-Headed Giant variant. Teammates may review each other�s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can�t manipulate each other�s cards or permanents.

810.6. The team who plays first skips the draw step of its first turn.

810.7. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses a modified version of the combat rules for the shared team turns option.

810.7a Each team�s creatures attack the other team as a group. During the combat phase, the active team is the attacking team and each player on the active team is an attacking player. Likewise, the nonactive team is the defending team and each player on the nonactive team is a defending player.

810.7b Any one-shot effect that refers to the �defending player� refers to one specific defending player, not to both of the defending players. The controller of the effect chooses which one the spell or ability refers to at the time the effect is applied. The same is true for any one-shot effect that refers to the �attacking player.�
     Any characteristic-defining ability that refers to the �defending player� refers to one specific defending player, not to both of the defending players. The controller of the object with the characteristic-defining ability chooses which one the ability refers to at the time the nonactive players become defending players. If that time has already occurred, that player makes that choice as the object enters the battlefield or gains the ability.
     All other cases in which the �defending player� is referred to actually refer to both defending players. If the reference involves a positive comparison (such as asking whether the defending player controls an Island) or a relative comparison (such as asking whether you control more creatures than the defending player), it gets only one answer. This answer is �yes� if either defending player in the comparison would return a �yes� answer if compared individually. If the reference involves a negative comparison (such as asking whether the defending player controls no black permanents), it also gets only one answer. This answer is �yes� if performing the analogous positive comparison would return a �no� answer. The same is true for all other cases that refer to the �attacking player.�

810.7c As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares attackers. If an effect of an object controlled by a defending player prohibits a creature from attacking him or her, that creature can�t attack the defending team. The active team has one combined attack, and that set of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 508.1.
Example: One player in a Two-Headed Giant game controls Teferi�s Moat, which says �As Teferi�s Moat enters the battlefield, choose a color.� and �Creatures of the chosen color without flying can�t attack you.� Creatures of the chosen color without flying can�t attack that player�s team.

810.7d As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares blockers. Creatures controlled by the defending players can block any attacking creatures. The defending team has one combined block, and that set of blocking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 509.1.
Example: If an attacking creature has forestwalk and either player on the defending team controls a Forest, the creature can�t be blocked.

810.7e Once blockers have been declared, for each attacking creature that�s become blocked by multiple creatures, the active team announces the damage assignment order among the blocking creatures. Then, for each creature that�s blocking multiple creatures, the defending team announces the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures.

810.7f As the combat damage step begins, the active team announces how each attacking creature will assign its combat damage. If an attacking creature would assign combat damage to the defending team, the active team chooses only one of the defending players for that creature to assign its combat damage to. Then the defending team announces how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage. See rule 510.1.

810.8. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule 104), with the following additions and specifications.

810.8a Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals. If either player on a team loses the game, the team loses the game. If either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game. If an effect says that a player can�t win the game, that player�s team can�t win the game. If an effect says that a player can�t lose the game, that player�s team can�t lose the game.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Transcendence, which reads, in part, �You don�t lose the game for having 0 or less life.� If that player�s team�s life total is 0 or less, that team doesn�t lose the game.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player attempts to draw a card while there are no cards in that player�s library. That player loses the game, so that player�s entire team loses the game.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Platinum Angel, which reads, �You can�t lose the game and your opponents can�t win the game.� Neither that player nor their teammate can lose the game while Platinum Angel is on the battlefield, and neither player on the opposing team can win the game.

810.8b If a player concedes, their team leaves the game immediately. That team loses the game.

810.8c If a team�s life total is 0 or less, the team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)

810.8d If a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)

810.9. Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player individually. The result is applied to the team�s shared life total.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player casts Flame Rift, which reads, �Flame Rift deals 4 damage to each player.� Each team is dealt a total of 8 damage.

810.9a If a cost or effect needs to know the value of an individual player�s life total, that cost or effect uses the team�s life total instead.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 17 life is targeted by Beacon of Immortality, which reads, in part, �Double target player�s life total.� That player gains 17 life, so the team winds up at 34 life.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Test of Endurance, an enchantment that reads, �At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 50 or more life, you win the game.� At the beginning of that player�s upkeep, the player�s team wins the game if their team�s life total is 50 or more.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 11 life controls Lurking Evil, an enchantment that reads, �Pay half your life, rounded up: Lurking Evil becomes a 4/4 Horror creature with flying.� To activate the ability, that player must pay 6 life. The team winds up at 5 life.

810.9b If a cost or effect allows both members of a team to pay life simultaneously, the total amount of life they pay may not exceed their team�s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)

810.9c If an effect sets a single player�s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total. The team�s life total is adjusted by the amount of life that player gained or lost.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 25 life is targeted by an ability that reads, �Target player�s life total becomes 10.� That player�s life total is considered to be 25, so that player loses 15 life. The team winds up at 10 life.

810.9d If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a number, that team chooses one of its members. On that team, only that player is affected.
Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, one team has 7 life and the other team has 13 life. A player casts Repay in Kind, which reads, �Each player�s life total becomes the lowest life total among all players.� Each team chooses one of its members to be affected. The result is that the chosen player on the team that has 13 life loses 6 life, so that team�s life total winds up at 7.

810.9e A player can�t exchange life totals with their teammate. If an effect would cause that to occur, the exchange won�t happen.

810.9f If an effect instructs a player to redistribute any number of players� life totals, that player may not affect more than one member of each team this way.

810.9g If an effect says that a player can�t gain life, no player on that player�s team can gain life.

810.9h If an effect says that a player can�t lose life, no player on that player�s team can lose life or pay any amount of life other than 0.

810.10. Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison counters are shared by the team.

810.10a If an effect needs to know how many poison counters an individual player has, that effect uses the number of poison counters that player�s team has. If an effect needs to know how many poison counters a player�s opponents have, that effect uses the number of poison counters opposing teams have.

810.10b If an effect says that a player loses poison counters, that player�s team loses that many poison counters.

810.10c If an effect says that a player can�t get poison counters, no player on that player�s team can get poison counters.

810.10d If a rule or effect needs to know what kinds of counters an individual player has, that effect uses the kinds of counters that player has and the kinds of counters that player�s team has. A player is �poisoned� if that player�s team has one or more poison counters.

810.11. The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players. For each player a team has beyond the second, that team�s starting life total is increased by 15 and the number of poison counters required for the team to lose is increased by five. (These variants are called Three-Headed Giant, Four-Headed Giant, and so on.)

811. Alternating Teams Variant

811.1. Alternating Teams games are played with two or more teams of equal size.

811.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Alternating Teams variant uses the following default options.

811.2a The recommended range of influence is 2. See rule 801, �Limited Range of Influence Option.�

811.2b Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See rule 803, �Attack Left and Attack Right Options,� and rule 802, �Attack Multiple Players Option.�

811.2c The deploy creatures option isn�t normally used in the Alternating Teams variant.

811.3. At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is equally spaced out.
Example: In an Alternating Teams game with three teams, A, B, and C, the seating around the table at the start of the game is A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3, and so on.

811.4. A player can�t attack opponents who aren�t seated next to them.

811.5. In the Alternating Teams variant, a team�s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates can�t review each other�s hands unless they are sitting next to each other. Teammates may discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can�t manipulate each other�s cards or permanents.


9. Casual Variants

900. General

900.1. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for certain casual game variants. It is by no means comprehensive.

900.2. The casual variants detailed here use supplemental zones, rules, cards, and other game implements not used in traditional Magic games.

901. Planechase

901.1. In the Planechase variant, plane cards and phenomenon cards add additional abilities and randomness to the game. The Planechase variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.

901.2. A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, �Free-for-All Variant.�

901.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a planar deck of at least ten plane and/or phenomenon cards and the game needs one planar die. No more than two cards in a planar deck can be phenomenon cards. Each card in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule 309, �Planes,� and rule 310, �Phenomena.�)

901.3a A planar die is a six-sided die. One face has the Planeswalker symbol {PW}. One face has the chaos symbol {CHAOS}. The other faces are blank.

901.4. At the start of the game, each player shuffles their planar deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each deck is placed face down next to its owner�s library. All plane and phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they�re part of a planar deck and while they�re face up.

901.5. Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to take an action with those cards from their opening hands, the starting player moves the top card of his or her planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If it�s a plane card, that card is the starting plane. If it�s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of his or her planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. (See rule 103.6.) No abilities of any card turned face up this way trigger during this process.

901.6. The owner of a plane or phenomenon card is the player who started the game with it in their planar deck. The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn�t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.

901.7. Any abilities of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card in the command zone function from that zone. The card�s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.

901.7a A face-up plane card or phenomenon card that�s turned face down becomes a new object.

901.8. Planechase games have an inherent triggered ability known as the �planeswalking ability.� The full text of this ability is �Whenever you roll {PW}, planeswalk.� (See rule 701.22, �Planeswalk.�) This ability has no source and is controlled by the player whose planar die roll caused it to trigger. This is an exception to rule 112.8.

901.9. Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of their turn, that player may roll the planar die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. This is a special action and doesn�t use the stack. Note that this number won�t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. (See rule 115.2g.)

901.9a If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens. The active player gets priority.

901.9b If the die roll is the chaos symbol {CHAOS}, any ability of a face-up plane that starts �When you roll {CHAOS}� triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority.

901.9c If the die roll is the Planeswalker symbol {PW}, the �planeswalking ability� triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority. (See rule 901.8.)

901.10. When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player except abilities from phenomena leave the game. (See rule 800.4a.) If that includes a face-up plane card or phenomenon card, the planar controller turns the top card of their planar deck face up. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game.

901.10a If a plane leaves the game while a �planeswalking ability� is on the stack, that ability ceases to exist.

901.10b Abilities from phenomena owned by a player who left the game remain on the stack controlled by the new planar controller.

901.11. After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of his or her planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player has �planeswalked.� Continuous effects with durations that last until a player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger. See rule 701.22.

901.11a A player may planeswalk as the result of the �planeswalking ability� (see rule 901.8), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenon�s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.5w). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.

901.11b The plane card that�s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card or phenomenon card that�s turned face down, or that leaves the game, is the plane or phenomenon the player planeswalks away from.

901.11c If a player planeswalks when there is more than one face-up plane card, that player planeswalks away from all such planes.

901.12. A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planechase casual variant, with the following additions.

901.12a Each player has their own planar deck.

901.12b The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active team. However, if the current planar controller�s team would leave the game, instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that wouldn�t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller�s team leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different team becomes the active team, whichever comes first.

901.12c Even though the face-up plane or phenomenon is controlled by just one player, any ability of that plane or phenomenon that refers to �you� applies to both members of the planar controller�s team.

901.12d Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of them may roll the planar die. Each player�s cost to roll the planar die is based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled the planar die that turn.

901.13. In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. (See rule 801, �Limited Range of Influence Option.�)

901.14. In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards or phenomenon cards may be face up at the same time.

901.14a Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who will start the game with a turn marker sets a starting plane (see rule 901.5). Each of them is a planar controller.

901.14b If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, that player first ceases to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar controller), then that player leaves the game. Each face-up plane card or phenomenon card that player controlled is put on the bottom of its owner�s planar deck. No player is considered to have planeswalked.

901.15. Single Planar Deck Option

901.15a As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a single communal planar deck. In that case, the number of cards in the planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of players in the game, whichever is smaller. The planar deck can�t contain more phenomenon cards than twice the number of players in the game. Each card in the planar deck must have a different English name.

901.15b In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be the owner of all cards in the planar deck.

901.15c If any rule or ability refers to a player�s planar deck, the communal planar deck is used.

902. Vanguard

902.1. In the Vanguard variant, a vanguard card allows each player to play the role of a famous character. Each player will have one face-up vanguard card whose abilities and other characteristics affect the game. The Vanguard variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.

902.2. A Vanguard game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.

902.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a vanguard card. Each vanguard card is placed face up next to its owner�s library before the game begins. All vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game.

902.4. Each player�s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.
Example: The life modifier of a player�s vanguard card is -3. That player�s starting life total is 17.

902.5. Each player�s starting hand size is seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.

902.5a If a player takes a mulligan in a Vanguard game, just like in a normal game, that player shuffles their hand back into their library, then draws a new hand of one fewer cards than they had before. (In a multiplayer game, a player�s first mulligan is for the same number of cards as they had before.) See rule 103.4.
Example: The hand modifier of a player�s vanguard card is +2. That player starts the game with a hand of 9 cards. If the player takes a mulligan, they draw a new hand of 8 cards. The next mulligan is for 7 cards, and so on.

902.5b A player�s maximum hand size is seven, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
Example: The hand modifier of a player�s vanguard card is -1. That player�s maximum hand size is six. If that player has more than six cards in their hand as their cleanup step begins, they will discard all but six of them.

902.6. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.

902.7. Any abilities of a face-up vanguard card in the command zone function from that zone. The card�s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.

903. Commander

903.1. In the Commander variant, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deck�s commander. The Commander variant was created and popularized by fans; an independent rules committee maintains additional resources at MTGCommander.net. The Commander variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.

903.2. A Commander game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, �Free-for-All Variant.�

903.3. Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its commander. This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.
Example: A commander that�s been turned face down (due to Ixidron�s effect, for example) is still a commander. A commander that�s copying another card (due to Cytoshape�s effect, for example) is still a commander. A permanent that�s copying a commander (such as a Body Double, for example, copying a commander in a player�s graveyard) is not a commander.

903.3a Some planeswalker cards have an ability that states the card can be your commander. This ability modifies the rules for deck construction, and it functions before the game begins. See also rule 112.6m.

903.3b If a player�s commander is a meld card and it�s melded with the other member of its meld pair, the resulting melded permanent is that player�s commander.

903.4. The Commander variant uses color identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain commander. The color identity of a card is the color or colors of any mana symbols in that card�s mana cost or rules text, plus any colors defined by its characteristic-defining abilities (see rule 604.3) or color indicator (see rule 204).
Example: Bosh, Iron Golem is a legendary artifact creature with mana cost {8} and the ability �{3}{R}, Sacrifice an artifact: Bosh, Iron Golem deals damage equal to the sacrificed artifact�s converted mana cost to target creature or player.� Bosh�s color identity is red.

903.4a Color identity is established before the game begins.

903.4b Reminder text is ignored when determining a card�s color identity. See rule 207.2.

903.4c The back face of a double-faced card (see rule 711) is included when determining a card�s color identity. This is an exception to rule 711.4a.
Example: Civilized Scholar is the front face of a double-faced card with mana cost {2}{U}. Homicidal Brute is the back face of that double-faced card and has a red color indicator. The card�s color identity is blue and red.

903.5. Each Commander deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.

903.5a Each deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its commander.

903.5b Other than basic lands, each card in a Commander deck must have a different English name.

903.5c A card can be included in a Commander deck only if every color in its color identity is also found in the color identity of the deck�s commander.
Example: Wort, the Raidmother is a legendary creature with mana cost {4}{R/G}{R/G}. Wort�s color identity is red and green. Each card in a Wort Commander deck must be only red, only green, both red and green, or have no color. Each mana symbol in the mana cost or rules text of a card in this deck must be only red, only green, both red and green, or have no color.

903.5d A card with a basic land type may be included in a Commander deck only if each color of mana it could produce is included in the commander�s color identity.
Example: Wort, the Raidmother�s color identity is red and green. A Wort Commander deck may include land cards with the basic land types Mountain and/or Forest. It can�t include any land cards with the basic land types Plains, Island, or Swamp.

903.6. At the start of the game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone. Then each player shuffles the remaining 99 cards of their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Those cards become the player�s library.

903.7. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 40 and draws a hand of seven cards.

903.8. A player may cast a commander he or she owns from the command zone. A commander cast from the command zone costs an additional {2} for each previous time the player casting it has cast it from the command zone that game.

903.9. If a commander would be exiled from anywhere or put into its owner�s hand, graveyard, or library from anywhere, its owner may put it into the command zone instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule 614.5.

903.9a If a commander is a melded permanent and its owner chooses to put it into the command zone this way, that permanent and the card representing it that isn�t a commander are put into the appropriate zone, and the card that represents it and is a commander is put into the command zone.

903.10. The Commander variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)

903.10a A player that�s been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)

904. Archenemy

904.1. In the Archenemy variant, a team of players faces off against a single opponent strengthened with powerful scheme cards. The Archenemy variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.

904.2. The default setup for an Archenemy game is the Team vs. Team multiplayer variant (see rule 808) involving exactly two teams. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) and the shared team turns option (see rule 805) are used; no other multiplayer options are used.

904.2a One of the teams consists of exactly one player, who is designated the archenemy.

904.2b The other team consists of any number of players.

904.3. In addition to the normal game materials, the archenemy needs a scheme deck of at least twenty scheme cards. A scheme deck may contain no more than two of any card with a particular English name. (See rule 312, �Schemes.�)

904.4. At the start of the game, the archenemy shuffles their scheme deck so that the cards are in a random order. The scheme deck is placed face down next to the archenemy�s library. All scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they�re part of a scheme deck and while they�re face up.

904.5. The archenemy�s starting life total is 40. Each other player�s starting life total is 20.

904.6. Rather than a randomly determined player, the archenemy takes the first turn of the game.

904.7. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.

904.8. Any abilities of a face-up scheme card in the command zone function from that zone. The card�s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.

904.9. Immediately after the archenemy�s precombat main phase begins during each of his or her turns, that player moves the top card of his or her scheme deck off that scheme deck and turns it face up. This is called �setting that scheme in motion.� (See rule 701.23.) This turn-based action doesn�t use the stack. Abilities of that scheme card that trigger �When you set this scheme in motion� trigger.

904.10. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner�s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)

904.11. Once an ongoing scheme card is set in motion, it remains face up in the command zone until an ability causes it to be abandoned (see rule 701.24).

904.12. Supervillain Rumble Option

904.12a As an alternative option, players may play a Free-for-All game in which each player has their own scheme deck. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) is used; no other multiplayer options are used.

904.12b Each player in this game is an archenemy.

904.12c As in a normal Free-for-All game, the starting player is randomly determined. All other rules that apply to the archenemy in an Archenemy game apply to each player in a Supervillain Rumble game.

905. Conspiracy Draft

905.1. The Conspiracy Draft variant consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Conspiracy Draft variant uses Magic: The Gathering�Conspiracy� booster packs by default.

905.1a A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts one card by placing that card in a face-down pile in front of the player, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts a card from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.

905.1b In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each player�s left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each player�s right.

905.1c During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from, cards they have already drafted, cards that are currently revealed as described in rule 905.2b, and cards that have been drafted face up as described in rule 905.2c. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to.

905.1d After the draft and all actions that may be taken during or after the draft, all the cards a player has drafted become that player�s card pool. The player builds their deck from only these cards and any number of basic land cards. See rules 100.2b and 100.4b.

905.2. Several cards in the Magic: The Gathering�Conspiracy set have abilities that function during the draft.

905.2a During a draft, there is no active player or system of priority. If multiple players wish to take an action at the same time during the draft and can�t agree on an order, those actions are taken in a random order.

905.2b Some cards instruct players to reveal them as they�re drafted and then note some information, such as a number or color. This information can be referred to by other abilities during the game.
